# feature New Prompt on Prompt Editor

# ToDo

Curently the prompt editor window does not have a New Prompt button (and shortcut). Let's add one, exactly like on the home page.

I want to modify New Prompt dialog:
* Add a new button "Create in new tab" with ctrl+shift+enter as the keyboard shortcut. 
* Hovertext on all buttons and fields should show the keyboard shortcut for that button.
