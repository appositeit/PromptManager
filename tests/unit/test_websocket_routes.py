Unit tests for WebSocket routes.

Tests the WebSocket endpoints for prompt editing.
"""


# Import what's needed for the remaining prompt endpoint tests
# If PromptService is directly used or mocked, ensure it's imported if necessary.

# If there are tests for the main websocket_endpoint (for prompts), they would go here.
# For now, if all tests were fragment related, this file might become empty of test classes.

# Example structure if there were prompt-related tests:
# class TestPromptWebSocketRoutes:
#     @pytest.mark.asyncio
#     async def test_prompt_endpoint_initial_data(self, monkeypatch):
#         # ... test logic for prompt endpoint ...
#         pass

# If after removing fragment tests, no other tests remain in this file for websocket_endpoint,
# this file might be a candidate for deletion or refactoring if prompt websocket tests are elsewhere.
# For now, just removing the fragment-specific class.
