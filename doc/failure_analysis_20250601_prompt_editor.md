# Failure Analysis: Prompt Editor Regression

**Date:** 2025-06-01
**Reporter:** AI Assistant (Claude)
**Severity:** Critical - Complete loss of core functionality

## 1. Triage the Issue

### Symptom
- **What happened:** Prompt editor page loads but CodeMirror editor area is completely empty
- **Impact:** Complete loss of editing functionality - users cannot edit prompts
- **Scope:** Affects all prompt editor pages across the application
- **When discovered:** During testing after implementing "New Prompt" button feature

### User Experience Impact
- Users see the page layout but cannot edit content
- No error messages visible to users
- Page appears "broken" with missing core functionality
- All editing workflows completely blocked

## 2. Link to Origin

### Root Cause Chain
1. **Primary Cause:** JavaScript variable name conflict
   - Global variable `let newPromptModal = null;` in `new_prompt_modal.js`
   - Local variable `let newPromptModal = null;` in prompt_editor.html template
   - ES6 `let` declarations cannot be redeclared in same scope
   - Browser throws "Identifier 'newPromptModal' has already been declared" error

2. **Secondary Causes:**
   - Forward reference: `window.promptHint` used before definition
   - DOM timing: DOMContentLoaded assumptions not handling all scenarios

### Change That Introduced Issue
- **Feature:** Adding "New Prompt" button to prompt editor page
- **AI Action:** Modified prompt_editor.html template to include new prompt functionality
- **Oversight:** Failed to check for global variable conflicts with imported JavaScript files

## 3. Fix and Document

### Immediate Fix Applied
1. **Variable Conflict Resolution:**
   ```javascript
   // Changed from:
   let newPromptModal = null;
   // To:
   let editorNewPromptModal = null;
   ```

2. **Function Order Fix:**
   - Moved `window.promptHint` definition before `initializeEditor()` function

3. **DOM Ready State Handling:**
   ```javascript
   if (document.readyState === 'loading') {
       document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initializePromptEditor);
   } else {
       initializePromptEditor();
   }
   ```

### Verification Steps
- ✅ Page loads without JavaScript errors
- ✅ CodeMirror editor displays content
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ New prompt button works correctly
- ✅ E2E tests pass

## 4. Prevention Analysis

### Why This Happened
1. **Insufficient Testing:** Changes were made without running browser-based tests immediately
2. **Global Scope Unawareness:** Didn't check what global variables were declared in imported JS files
3. **No Static Analysis:** No tools to catch variable conflicts at development time
4. **Incremental Development:** Made multiple related changes without testing each step

### AI-Specific Failure Patterns
- **Over-confidence:** Assumed variable names were safe without checking imports
- **Context Switching:** Lost track of global state while focused on template changes
- **Missing Error Handling:** Didn't implement proper error detection/fallback mechanisms

## 5. Prevention Measures

### Immediate Actions (Implemented)
1. **Better Variable Naming:** Use more specific prefixes for local variables
2. **Error Handling:** Add try/catch blocks around initialization code
3. **DOM State Checking:** Handle both early and late script execution

### Recommended Process Improvements

#### For AI Development
1. **Pre-change Checks:**
   - Always check imported JS files for global variable declarations
   - List all global variables before adding new ones
   - Use browser developer tools to verify no conflicts

2. **Incremental Testing:**
   - Test after each significant change, not just at the end
   - Use browser console to check for JavaScript errors immediately
   - Run `make test-e2e` after any template modifications

3. **Static Analysis:**
   - Implement JSHint/ESLint for JavaScript static analysis
   - Add pre-commit hooks to catch common issues
   - Consider using TypeScript for better compile-time checking

#### For Code Quality
1. **Namespace Management:**
   - Use module pattern or namespaces for related functionality
   - Avoid global variables where possible
   - Use unique prefixes for component-specific variables

2. **Error Detection:**
   - Add window.onerror handler to catch JavaScript errors
   - Implement fallback mechanisms for critical functionality
   - Add visual indicators when JavaScript fails to load

3. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Add specific tests for JavaScript initialization
   - Test with different DOM loading scenarios
   - Include regression tests for critical user flows

### Tools to Prevent Recurrence
- **ESLint:** Catch variable redeclaration errors
- **Browser Dev Tools:** Monitor console for errors during development  
- **E2E Tests:** Automated testing of critical user flows
- **Code Review:** Check for global variable conflicts before merging

## 6. Learning Outcomes

### For AI Assistants
- Always check browser console immediately after JavaScript changes
- Be aware of global scope pollution from multiple script files
- Test incrementally rather than making multiple changes at once
- Use more specific variable names to avoid conflicts

### For Project Process
- The regression tracking system successfully identified the issue
- Need better integration between development and testing phases
- Consider automated checks for common JavaScript pitfalls

This analysis follows the project's failure detection and response process to ensure we learn from this regression and prevent similar issues in the future.
