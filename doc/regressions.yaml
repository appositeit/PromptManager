    broken_feature: "unit test execution"
    break_commit: "e2226e9a"
    fix_commit: "472490b"
    ai_involved: true
    pattern: ["missing-pythonpath", "test-configuration", "taskfile-inconsistency"]
    severity: "critical"
    impact: "Prevents all unit tests from running, blocking development workflow"
