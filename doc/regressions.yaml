  - date: 2025-05-30
    symptom: "Session management tests failing with function not found errors and incorrect response generation"

  - date: 2025-05-30
    symptom: "WebSocket test failing due to dependency list order mismatch"
    cause: "Test assertion compared list order from set iteration, which is non-deterministic"

  - date: 2025-06-06
    symptom: "New Prompt button missing from Prompt Editor page, drag and drop list of prompts in current directory missing"
