# Feature: ESLint Integration

## Overview
ESLint integration provides automated JavaScript code quality checking and prevents regressions like the variable redeclaration issue that broke the prompt editor.

## Design Decision
- **Tool Choice:** ESLint with modern flat config format (`eslint.config.js`)
- **Integration:** Makefile targets for easy development workflow
- **Auto-fix:** Automatic correction of simple style issues
- **Configuration:** Comprehensive global definitions for browser environment

## Configuration Highlights

### Rules Targeting Known Issues
```javascript
"no-redeclare": "error",              // ⭐ Would have caught newPromptModal conflict
"no-undef": "error",                  // ⭐ Would have caught window.promptHint forward reference
"curly": "error",                     // Require curly braces for all control statements
"no-implicit-globals": "error",       // Prevent accidental globals
```

### Browser Environment Support
- All standard browser globals (window, document, fetch, etc.)
- Browser APIs (localStorage, WebSocket, CustomEvent, etc.)
- Third-party libraries (bootstrap, CodeMirror, d3, marked, etc.)
- Application-specific globals (showToast, NewPromptModal, etc.)

## Usage

### Development Workflow
```bash
make lint-js        # Check for issues
make lint-js-fix    # Auto-fix simple issues
```

### Integration Points
- **Pre-development:** Run before major changes
- **Debugging:** Use when JavaScript issues arise
- **Code review:** Include in review process
- **CI/CD:** Can be added to automated testing

## Impact Metrics

### Before Integration
- 187 total problems (157 errors, 30 warnings)
- Critical parsing errors blocking functionality
- No automated quality checking

### After Integration  
- 83 total problems (54 errors, 29 warnings)
- 54 issues auto-fixed
- Critical syntax errors detected and fixed
- Ongoing prevention of regressions

## Regression Prevention

ESLint would have prevented the prompt editor break because:
1. **Variable redeclaration** - `no-redeclare` rule catches duplicate declarations
2. **Undefined references** - `no-undef` rule catches forward references
3. **Syntax errors** - Parser catches structural issues like duplicate else clauses

## Future Enhancements

### Immediate Opportunities
- Address remaining 54 errors about global scope functions
- Add pre-commit hooks for automatic checking
- Configure IDE integration for real-time feedback

### Advanced Features
- Custom rules for project-specific patterns
- Integration with code coverage reporting
- Automated fixing in CI/CD pipeline

## Maintenance

### Configuration Updates
- Add new globals as third-party libraries are introduced
- Adjust rules based on team feedback and project evolution
- Update ESLint version and rule definitions periodically

### Rule Refinement
- Monitor false positives and adjust rules
- Add exceptions for specific use cases
- Balance strictness with development velocity

This feature provides the foundation for maintaining JavaScript code quality and preventing the type of regressions that previously broke critical functionality.
