# Feature Design: ESLint Integration for JavaScript Quality

**Date:** 2025-06-01
**Feature:** ESLint static analysis for JavaScript files
**Status:** Proposed

## Problem Statement

The recent prompt editor regression was caused by JavaScript variable conflicts that could have been caught by static analysis. ESLint would have detected:

1. **Variable redeclaration errors** - The exact issue we had with `newPromptModal`
2. **Undefined variable usage** - Forward references like `window.promptHint`
3. **Code quality issues** - Unused variables, inconsistent formatting
4. **Best practices violations** - Global scope pollution, missing error handling

## Proposed Solution

### ESLint Configuration
- **Target:** All JavaScript files in `src/static/js/` and inline scripts in templates
- **Ruleset:** Standard ESLint rules + custom rules for our patterns
- **Integration:** Pre-commit hooks, make targets, and development workflow

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Basic Setup
1. Install ESLint and basic configuration
2. Create `.eslintrc.js` with appropriate rules
3. Add `make lint` target for manual checking
4. Fix existing issues in current codebase

#### Phase 2: Template Linting
1. Extract inline JavaScript from templates for linting
2. Create tool to validate template JavaScript blocks
3. Add specific rules for template-specific patterns

#### Phase 3: Automation
1. Add pre-commit hooks to run ESLint
2. Integrate with development workflow
3. Add CI/CD checks if applicable

## Benefits

### Immediate Detection
- **Variable conflicts:** `error: Identifier 'newPromptModal' has already been declared`
- **Undefined references:** `error: 'window.promptHint' is not defined`
- **Unused variables:** `warning: 'directories' is defined but never used`

### Code Quality
- Consistent formatting and style
- Best practices enforcement
- Documentation of coding standards

### Development Workflow
- Catch issues before browser testing
- Standardize code across the project
- Reduce debugging time

## Configuration Strategy

### Rules to Enable
- `no-redeclare`: Prevent variable redeclaration (would have caught our issue)
- `no-undef`: Require variables to be declared before use
- `no-unused-vars`: Catch unused variable declarations
- `no-global-assign`: Prevent assignment to global variables

### Custom Rules for Our Project
- Prefix requirements for component-specific variables
- Global variable registration patterns
- Template-specific linting rules

## Implementation Details

This feature addresses the root cause of our recent regression and establishes systematic quality control for JavaScript development.
