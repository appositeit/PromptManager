# Progress: Successful Merge of Better-Identifiers Branch

**Date:** Friday, June 6, 2025  
**Time:** 23:45 +1000 (Sydney)  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - All edge features successfully merged into main  
**Branch:** `main` (merged from `feature/better-identifiers`)

## 🎯 Objective

Successfully merge all advanced features from the `feature/better-identifiers` branch into `main`, bringing together all the edge features that had been developed.

## 🔄 Merge Process

### **1. Pre-Merge Preparation**
- Ran tests on `feature/better-identifiers`: ✅ 287 passed, 7 skipped, 14 warnings
- Verified linting passed with only minor warnings (no errors)
- Committed any uncommitted changes

### **2. Merge Execution**
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/better-identifiers
```

### **3. Conflict Resolution**
Encountered several merge conflicts:

**Python Cache Files (Auto-resolved):**
- Deleted all `__pycache__` files as intended
- These were properly excluded from the final merge

**Content Conflicts (Manual resolution):**
- **`doc/regressions.yaml`**: Combined regression entries from both branches
- **`src/templates/manage_prompts.html`**: Chose better-identifiers version with advanced display name functionality
- **`src/templates/prompt_editor.html`**: Chose better-identifiers version with complete UI features

**Pre-commit Hook Fix:**
- Fixed root directory protection hook to properly filter allowed files
- `eslint.config.js` was correctly recognized as an allowed root file

### **4. Merge Completion**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Merge better-identifiers branch with all edge features"
```
