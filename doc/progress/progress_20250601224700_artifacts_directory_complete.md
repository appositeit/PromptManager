# Centralized Artifacts Directory Implementation

**Date:** 2025-06-01  
**Status:** Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented a centralized `artifacts/` directory structure to organize all transient build artifacts, logs, and temporary files. This replaces the previous scattered approach where artifacts were spread throughout the project.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Directory Structure Created ✅
```
artifacts/
├── coverage/          # Test coverage reports (HTML, XML, etc.)
├── logs/             # Application and server logs
├── reports/          # Lint reports, test reports, code analysis
├── temp/             # Temporary files and build artifacts
└── README.md         # Documentation for the structure
```

### 2. Makefile Updates ✅
- **Updated all coverage targets** to use `artifacts/coverage/`
- **Updated lint-cpd** to output to `artifacts/reports/jscpd/`
- **Modified clean targets**: 
  - `make clean` - Removes build artifacts (preserves logs)
  - `make clean-all` - Removes everything including logs
- **Updated ignore patterns** to exclude `artifacts/` from code duplication checks

### 3. Bin Scripts Migration ✅
- **start_prompt_manager.sh** - Now uses `artifacts/logs/` for server logs and PID files
- **stop_prompt_manager.sh** - Updated to look for PID files in `artifacts/logs/`
- **restart_prompt_manager.sh** - Updated log path references

### 4. Git Configuration ✅
- **Updated .gitignore** to ignore `artifacts/` directory
- **Preserved legacy entries** for backward compatibility
- **Moved existing files** from old locations to new structure

### 5. Migration Completed ✅
- **Moved all existing coverage reports** to `artifacts/coverage/`
- **Moved all logs** to `artifacts/logs/`
- **Fixed broken symlinks** after migration
- **Removed old empty directories**

## Benefits Achieved

### 🎯 **Centralization**
- All transient files now in one location (`artifacts/`)
- Easy to find any generated artifact
- Consistent organization across all tools

### 🧹 **Simplified Cleanup**
- `rm -rf artifacts/` cleans everything
- `make clean` for smart cleanup (preserves logs)
- `make clean-all` for complete cleanup

### 📁 **Better .gitignore**
- Single line: `artifacts/` ignores all transient files
- No need to track individual artifact patterns
- Cleaner git status

### 🔧 **Improved Maintenance**
- Clear separation between source and generated files
- Easier backup/restore (skip artifacts directory)
- Consistent across development environments

## File Mappings

| Old Location | New Location | Purpose |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| `cov_html*/` | `artifacts/coverage/` | Coverage reports |
| `htmlcov/` | `artifacts/coverage/` | Legacy coverage |
| `logs/` | `artifacts/logs/` | Server and application logs |
| `logs/jscpd-report/` | `artifacts/reports/jscpd/` | Code duplication reports |

## Usage Examples

### Running Coverage Tests
```bash
make test-cov-html                    # → artifacts/coverage/basic/
make test-cov-comprehensive           # → artifacts/coverage/comprehensive/ 
make test-cov-true                   # → artifacts/coverage/true/
```

### Viewing Reports
```bash
open artifacts/coverage/basic/index.html       # Coverage report
open artifacts/reports/jscpd/index.html       # Code duplication
tail -f artifacts/logs/prompt_manager.log     # Live server logs
```

### Cleanup Commands
```bash
make clean        # Remove build artifacts, keep logs
make clean-all    # Remove everything including logs
rm -rf artifacts/ # Manual complete cleanup
```

## Backward Compatibility

- **Legacy paths** still work where referenced in documentation
- **Old .gitignore entries** preserved for transition period
- **Gradual migration** - no breaking changes to existing workflows

## Testing Verified

- ✅ Coverage reports generate in correct locations
- ✅ Server starts and logs to artifacts/logs/
- ✅ Clean commands work properly
- ✅ Git ignores artifacts directory
- ✅ All bin scripts use new paths

## Future Improvements

The artifacts structure is extensible for future needs:
- `artifacts/dist/` - Distribution packages
- `artifacts/docs/` - Generated documentation
- `artifacts/cache/` - Build caches
- `artifacts/test/` - Test-specific artifacts

This implementation provides a solid foundation for organized artifact management while maintaining project cleanliness and developer productivity.
