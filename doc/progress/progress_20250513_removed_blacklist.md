# Progress Update: Removed Directory Blacklisting Functionality

## Change Description
Removed the directory blacklisting functionality that was recently added to the prompt manager. This feature would prevent certain directories from being added or loaded automatically, but it has been deemed unnecessary for the current workflow.

## Implementation Details
1. Removed the `/api/prompts/directories/{directory_path}/blacklist` API endpoint
2. Removed the `permanent` parameter from the directory removal endpoint
3. Removed all blacklist-related code from the `PromptService._load_directory_config` method
4. Removed all blacklist-related code from the `PromptService._save_directory_config` method

## Files Modified
- `/home/jem/development/prompt_manager/src/api/router.py`
- `/home/jem/development/prompt_manager/src/services/prompt_service.py`

## Next Steps
The prompt manager will now handle all directories normally without any blacklisting functionality. Any directory can be added or removed through the regular API endpoints.
