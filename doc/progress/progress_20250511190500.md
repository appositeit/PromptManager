# Progress Update - 2025-05-11 19:05

## Server Start Issues Fixed

Fixed multiple issues preventing the Prompt Manager server from starting properly:

1. **YAML Parsing for Prompt Type**: 
   - Resolved an issue where the YAML front matter parser couldn't handle references to the old `coordinator` project
   - Enhanced error handling in the front matter parser to gracefully handle format errors
   - Added fallback mechanisms to properly detect prompt types even when YAML parsing fails

2. **Static Files Serving**:
   - Fixed an issue where static files weren't being properly mounted
   - Added code to ensure static directories exist and are created if missing
   - Improved logging around static file mounting

3. **Server Process Management**:
   - Enhanced the restart script to thoroughly terminate all previous server processes
   - Added checks to ensure port 8081 is free before starting a new server instance
   - Improved error handling and reporting in startup scripts

## Implementation Details

### YAML Parsing Improvements

The main issue was found in `prompt_service.py` where the YAML parser couldn't handle serialized `PromptType` objects from the old `coordinator` codebase. The fix included:

- Creating a custom YAML loader to handle the serialized objects
- Adding patterns to detect and convert type strings regardless of format
- Implementing robust fallback mechanisms for when YAML parsing fails
- Ensuring prompt types are properly detected from content even if metadata parsing fails

### Static Files Configuration

Fixed issues with static file serving:

- Added code to ensure all required static directories exist
- Improved logging to provide better visibility into static file configuration
- Ensured proper mounting of the static directory with the correct name

### Process Management

Improved the restart script to reliably handle process termination:

- Added multiple process termination strategies for different scenarios
- Added port availability checks before server start
- Implemented proper error handling for process management operations

## Next Steps

With the server now running properly, focus can return to implementing and enhancing the search and replace functionality as described in the most recent progress reports.

The next improvements should include:
- Testing the search/replace functionality in various editors
- Ensuring proper JavaScript resource loading
- Implementing additional UI enhancements

## Notes

This fix maintains compatibility with existing prompt files while providing a cleaner path forward for new prompt files. The enhancements to error handling and process management should make the server more robust and easier to maintain going forward.
