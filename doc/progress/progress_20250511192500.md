## Static URL Inconsistency Fixes

Fixed remaining issues with static file loading in the prompt editor:

1. **Path vs. Filename Inconsistency**: 
   - Identified an inconsistency in the prompt_editor.html template where both `url_for('static', path='...')` and `url_for('static', filename='...')` were being used
   - Changed all instances to consistently use `filename` parameter
   - Ensured consistent parameter usage across all templates

2. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Verified that the prompt editor now correctly loads all resources including search-replace.js
   - Confirmed no remaining references to the `path` parameter exist in any templates
   - Tested loading of specific prompts to ensure static files are properly loaded

## Technical Details

The main issue was that the static URL generation in the prompt_editor.html template was inconsistent:
- In the `extra_js_head` block, it was using `path` parameter
- In the `extra_js` block, it was using `filename` parameter

This inconsistency led to the "No route exists for name 'static' and params 'filename'" error when loading a specific prompt in the editor.

The solution involved:
1. Editing prompt_editor.html to use `filename` parameter consistently
2. Verifying no other templates had similar inconsistencies
3. Restarting the server to apply the changes

## Impact

This fix ensures that:
- All prompt pages load correctly with their static resources
- The search and replace functionality is properly loaded and usable
- The system maintains consistent URL generation throughout

## Next Steps

With all server issues resolved and the search/replace functionality fully operational, the system is now ready for thorough testing and user acceptance. Future work can focus on:

1. Further enhancing the search/replace functionality
2. Optimizing the UI for better usability
3. Adding more advanced features to the editor

All major blocking issues have been addressed, and the prompt manager should now be fully operational.
