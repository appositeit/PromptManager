# Progress Update - May 11, 2025 (WebSocket and Exit Endpoint Testing)

## Server Status

The Prompt Manager server is now running correctly on port 8081. Both the exit endpoint and WebSocket interface have been tested and are functioning as expected.

## Testing Results

### Exit Endpoint Testing
- The `/api/stop` endpoint works correctly - when called, it immediately stops the server
- This allows for clean server restarts without having to manually kill processes
- The server sends a proper JSON response with the PID before shutting down

### WebSocket Interface Testing
- The WebSocket interface is properly configured and functional  
- The WebSocket connections are correctly established for both prompts and fragments
- The WebSocket endpoints follow the expected paths:
  - `/api/prompts/ws/{prompt_id}` for prompts
  - `/api/prompts/ws/fragments/{fragment_id}` for fragments
- Real-time data synchronization works when multiple clients connect to the same document

### Debugging Tools
- The `/debug/websocket` page provides an excellent interface for testing WebSocket connections
- The page includes tools to:
  - Test connections to various endpoints
  - Send and receive messages
  - View connection status and responses

## Issues Resolved
The WebSocket interface now correctly uses consistent path prefixes that match client expectations. This was a critical fix that ensures the WebSocket functionality works properly in the real-time collaborative editing feature.

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding more comprehensive documentation for the WebSocket API
2. Implement more extensive error handling for WebSocket connections
3. Add more automated tests for the WebSocket functionality
4. Improve the UI feedback when WebSocket connections fail or recover
