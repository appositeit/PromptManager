# Progress Update - May 16, 2025 (WebSocket Interface Fixes)

## WebSocket Interface Improvements

After investigating the issues with the WebSocket interface, the following fixes have been implemented:

1. **Fixed WebSocket Path Mismatches**: 
   - Updated the WebSocket routes in `websocket_routes.py` to use consistent path prefixes that match client expectations
   - Changed the WebSocket endpoint path from `/ws/{prompt_id}` to `/api/prompts/ws/{prompt_id}`
   - Added a dedicated WebSocket endpoint for fragments at `/api/prompts/ws/fragments/{fragment_id}`

2. **Added Debug Tools**:
   - Created a WebSocket test page at `/debug/websocket` for easy connection testing
   - Added direct WebSocket echo endpoints for troubleshooting
   - Improved error logging for WebSocket connections

3. **Improved Client-Side Handling**:
   - Enhanced client-side WebSocket error handling in `fragment_editor.html` and `prompt_editor.html`
   - Added better fallback mechanisms when WebSocket connections fail
   - Improved reconnection logic

4. **Server Shutdown Improvements**:
   - Added a simplified `/api/stop` endpoint for immediate server shutdown
   - Ensured clean process termination to prevent port conflicts on restart

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Reliability**:
   - The WebSocket interface now connects reliably for both prompts and fragments
   - Consistent path naming prevents connection errors
   - Improved error handling gives better feedback when issues occur

2. **Better Development Experience**:
   - New test tools make debugging WebSocket issues much easier
   - Added process management endpoints for cleaner server restarts

3. **Graceful Fallbacks**:
   - The system now gracefully falls back to the REST API when WebSocket connections fail
   - Users won't experience application failures even if WebSockets aren't working

## Next Steps

1. **Further Testing**:
   - Test WebSocket connections with multiple concurrent clients
   - Verify performance with larger prompts and fragments
   
2. **Documentation**:
   - Add WebSocket API documentation
   - Document the testing tools for developers
