# Progress Update: Fixed Create New Prompt Functionality

## Change Description
Fixed the "Create New Prompt" functionality that was showing a JavaScript error in the console:
`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'value')`

## Issue
The `createPrompt` function was trying to read a value from a non-existent DOM element:
- The function was accessing `document.getElementById('promptType').value`
- However, this element doesn't exist in the form anymore as the prompt type field was previously removed

## Fix Implemented
- Removed the reference to the non-existent `promptType` element in the `createPrompt` function
- Preserved all other functionality of the prompt creation process
- Ensured proper validation of required fields continues to work

## Files Modified
- `/home/jem/development/prompt_manager/src/templates/manage_prompts.html`

## Testing
Verified that the "Create New Prompt" button now works correctly and creates new prompts without JavaScript errors.
