# Progress: 2025-05-19 - Server Consolidation and Rename Support

## Fixed Server Launch Process

We addressed a critical issue with the startup process where the application was using a simplified server (`bin/simplified_server.py`) instead of the proper application (`src/app.py`). This was causing the rename functionality to be missing from the running application.

### Changes Made

1. Updated `startup.py` to:
   - Preserve the simplified_server.py in the archive directory
   - Launch the main app.py directly
   - Add proper Python path settings to ensure imports work correctly

2. Enhanced `src/app.py` to:
   - Explicitly support the rename functionality from the router.py
   - Improve module path handling to ensure proper imports
   - Add more detailed logging during startup

3. Moved `bin/simplified_server.py` to the archive directory as requested

### Why This Matters

This consolidation ensures that there's only one entry point to the application - `app.py` - which includes all routes, including the rename functionality we previously added in `src/api/router.py`. 

The `startup.py` script now calls app.py directly, avoiding duplicate code and ensuring that all API endpoints are available including our newly added rename functionality.

### Next Steps

The application should now start correctly with the rename functionality working properly. Additional improvements could include:

1. Adding automated tests for the rename functionality
2. Enhancing error handling for edge cases (duplicate names, special characters, etc.)
3. Adding a progress indicator in the UI during rename operations
