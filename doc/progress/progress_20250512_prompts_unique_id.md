# Progress Update - 2025-05-12: Fixing Duplicate Prompt Names

## Issue Fixed: Duplicate Prompt Names from Different Directories

We've fixed a critical issue where prompts with the same name (filename) from different directories would conflict with each other, causing only one to be displayed in the UI. The root cause was that the system was using just the filename (without extension) as the unique key in the prompts dictionary, without considering the directory path.

## Solution Implemented

1. Added a `unique_id` field to the `Prompt` model to store a unique identifier that combines both directory and filename
2. Added a `get_unique_id` property method that generates a unique ID based on the directory name and the prompt ID
3. Modified the prompt loading, saving, and deletion logic to use this unique ID
4. Updated the UI to properly handle prompts with the same name from different directories
5. Ensured backward compatibility by keeping fallback methods that work with the original IDs

## Key Changes

### Models

- Added `unique_id` field to the `Prompt` model
- Added `get_unique_id` property to generate unique identifiers

### Services

- Updated `load_prompt` to generate and use unique IDs
- Modified `save_prompt` and `delete_prompt` to work with unique IDs
- Enhanced `get_prompt` to search by both unique ID and regular ID

### UI Changes

- Updated the prompt list to display prompts with duplicate names properly
- Modified link generation to ensure each prompt has the correct link even with duplicate names
- Updated the deletion flow to use the correct unique ID for deletion

## Testing

The changes have been tested to ensure that:
1. All prompts from all directories are now properly displayed in the UI
2. Prompts with the same name from different directories no longer conflict
3. Editing and deletion work correctly using the unique IDs

## Benefits

- The prompt manager can now handle prompt files with the same name from different directories
- The UI now displays all prompts rather than just the last one loaded
- The system maintains backward compatibility with older code and APIs
- The changes provide a foundation for better organization of prompts across multiple directories

## Next Steps

- Monitor the system to ensure the changes are working as expected
- Consider enhancing the UI to better indicate when prompts have the same name but are from different directories
- Test with a variety of prompt names and directory structures to ensure robustness
