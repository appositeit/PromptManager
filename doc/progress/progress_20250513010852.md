# Prompt Manager Editor Route Fix - May 13, 2025

## Summary

Fixed an issue with accessing the prompt editor routes. Previously, users were getting a 404 error when trying to access prompts through the web interface using the links from the manage prompts page.

## Identified Issues

1. Missing route in server.py for "/prompts/{prompt_id}" to handle prompt editing
2. Inconsistency between how frontend generated links (using unique_id) and what the backend expected

## Changes Made

1. Added a new route in server.py for the prompt editor:
   ```python
   @app.get("/prompts/{prompt_id}", response_class=HTMLResponse)
   async def prompt_editor(request: Request, prompt_id: str):
   ```

2. This new route:
   - Loads the PromptService to access prompts
   - First tries to match the prompt ID directly
   - If not found, tries to look up by unique_id
   - Returns 404 if still not found
   - Renders the prompt_editor.html template with the prompt data

3. Updated the frontend to consistently use regular prompt IDs in links:
   ```javascript
   // Always use the regular ID for consistency
   idLink.href = `/prompts/${encodeURIComponent(prompt.id)}`;
   ```

## Verification

Tested the changes by:
1. Confirming the server starts without errors
2. Verifying the prompt editor route is accessible (HTTP 200 status)
3. Confirming links in the management UI now work correctly

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding additional UI improvements to the prompt editor page
2. Add tests for the editor route
3. Consider adding more robust error handling for edge cases
4. Update documentation to reflect the new routing behavior
