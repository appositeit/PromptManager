# Progress Update - May 17, 2025 (Search and Replace Implementation)

## Completed Implementation

I've successfully implemented the search and replace functionality for the prompt manager. The implementation includes the following components:

### 1. Search/Replace Module

Created a standalone search/replace module (`search-replace.js`) that provides:

- A dialog interface for search and replace
- Regular expression support
- Case-sensitive search option
- Real-time highlighting of search matches
- Live preview of replacements
- Replace single occurrence or replace all
- Keyboard shortcuts for all actions
- Navigation between matches with previous/next buttons

### 2. Integration

The search/replace functionality has been integrated into three editor types:

- Fragment Editor
- Template Editor
- Prompt Editor

Each editor now features:

- A search/replace button in the toolbar
- Alt+R keyboard shortcut
- Context-aware functionality (only available in raw content view)

### 3. User Interface Improvements

- Dialog is positioned in the top right corner for visibility without obscuring content
- Results count shows current match and total matches
- Replacement preview is shown before committing changes
- Consistent styling that matches the application's look and feel

### 4. Testing

- Created a dedicated test page at `/debug/search-replace` to test the functionality in isolation
- Test page includes sample content with various patterns to test different search scenarios

## Technical Details

The implementation leverages CodeMirror's built-in functionality and extends it with:

- Custom UI for better user experience
- Enhanced regex support
- Real-time highlighting and preview capabilities
- Integration with the application's existing editor infrastructure

The implementation is modular, making it easy to update or enhance in the future.

## Next Steps

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Refine search for very large documents by adding progressive loading
   
2. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Consider adding history of recent searches
   - Add option to save common search patterns

3. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Support for multi-selection search/replace
   - Support for find/replace across multiple files
