## Bug Fix: Prompt Editor JavaScript Error

### Issue Identified

A JavaScript error was discovered in the prompt editor page. When selecting a prompt to edit, visible JavaScript code appeared at the top of the screen:

```javascript
// Helper function to show a toast notification function showToast(message, type = 'success') { 
// Create toast container if it doesn't exist let toastContainer = document.querySelector('.toast-container'); 
// ...additional code snippets...
```

### Root Cause

Upon investigation, the issue was identified in the `prompt_editor.html` template. The JavaScript code for the `showToast` function was incorrectly placed within the `{% block header_actions %}` block instead of in the proper JavaScript section of the template.

This caused the JavaScript code to be rendered as raw text in the header section rather than being executed as valid JavaScript code.

### Resolution

1. **Removed misplaced code**:
   - Removed the JavaScript function from the `header_actions` block where it was rendering as visible text
   - Button elements in the header area now display correctly without raw JavaScript code

2. **Relocated function**:
   - Added the `showToast` function to the proper JavaScript section at the bottom of the template
   - The function now operates correctly as intended without being visible in the UI

### Benefits

1. **Fixed visual artifacts**: Users no longer see JavaScript code text on the prompt editor page
2. **Improved code organization**: Code is now in the proper location within the template
3. **Restored functionality**: Toast notifications work correctly for user feedback

### Verification

The fix was tested by navigating to the prompt editor page and verifying that:
- No JavaScript code text appears in the header area
- Toast notifications function correctly when actions are performed (e.g., saving)
