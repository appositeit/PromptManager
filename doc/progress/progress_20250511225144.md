# Progress Update - May 11, 2025 (Edit Page UI Improvements)

## UI Improvements Implemented

The prompt editor page has been improved to optimize screen space and provide a cleaner interface:

1. **Removed Duplicate Prompt ID Display**
   - Eliminated redundant prompt ID display above the editor
   - The prompt ID is already visible in the page title/header
   - Hidden the span element while preserving JavaScript functionality

2. **Relocated Prompt Type and Last Updated Time**
   - Moved the prompt type badge and last updated timestamp from above the editor to the metadata sidebar
   - Added to the top of the metadata card for better organization

3. **Increased Editor Height**
   - Expanded the editor height now that space is available
   - Adjusted from `calc(85vh - 120px)` to `calc(85vh - 90px)`
   - Increased minimum height from 550px to 600px

## Benefits

These changes offer several improvements to the user experience:

- **Cleaner Interface**: Reduces visual clutter in the main editing area
- **Better Space Utilization**: More vertical space for the editor
- **Logical Grouping**: All metadata is now contained in the sidebar
- **Focused Editing**: The editor area is now completely dedicated to content

## Implementation Details

The implementation involved:
1. Removing the prompt ID and metadata bar from above the editor
2. Adding the type badge and last updated timestamp to the metadata sidebar
3. Preserving the HTML elements needed for JavaScript functionality but hiding them
4. Adjusting the editor height calculations to use the newly available space

These changes improve the prompt editor page while maintaining full functionality.
