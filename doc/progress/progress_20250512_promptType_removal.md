# Progress Update: Removing promptType 

Date: May 12, 2025

## Summary

The project has been refactored to remove the `PromptType` enumeration. Instead of relying on explicit prompt types, we've simplified the model to determine if a prompt is a composite by checking if it contains inclusion markers (`[[` and `]]`).

## Changes Made

1. **Model Simplification**:
   - Removed `PromptType` enum from `unified_prompt.py`
   - Added the `is_composite` property which determines if a prompt is composite based on content analysis

2. **Service Layer Updates**:
   - Removed all references to `PromptType` in `prompt_service.py`
   - Updated the prompt loading and saving logic to no longer handle or store prompt types
   - Front matter handling now excludes prompt type

3. **API Layer Updates**:
   - Removed `PromptType` references from the API router
   - Simplified the prompt creation and update endpoints to no longer handle prompt types

4. **File Organization**:
   - Moved unused files like `refactored_prompt_service.py` to the `archive` directory
   - Maintained code that was already refactored to not use `PromptType`

5. **Testing**:
   - Updated tests to ensure the `is_composite` property works correctly
   - All tests now pass with the new implementation

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Model**: The prompt model is now simpler and more intuitive, with fewer moving parts.
2. **Automatic Detection**: The type of a prompt is automatically determined based on its content rather than requiring explicit setting.
3. **Reduced Code**: Removed unnecessary enumerations and type-checking code, making the codebase more maintainable.
4. **Improved Robustness**: The system automatically detects composite prompts based on their content, reducing the chance of type mismatches.

## Next Steps

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: While the basic tests pass, we should add more comprehensive tests to ensure the new implementation handles all edge cases.
2. **Documentation Updates**: Update documentation to reflect the new approach of automatic prompt type detection.
3. **UI Updates**: Ensure the UI correctly displays composite prompts based on the new model.

## Technical Debt Addressed

This refactoring has removed a source of complexity from the codebase by eliminating an enumeration and simplifying the model. The code is now more maintainable and follows the principle of "making the right thing easy" by automatically detecting composite prompts.
