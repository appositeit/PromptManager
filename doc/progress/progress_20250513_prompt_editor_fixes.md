# Progress Update: Fixed Prompt Editor Bugs

## Change Description
Fixed multiple bugs in the prompt editor interface that had re-emerged:

1. **Auto-save Not Working**: Prompts were not automatically saving when content was changed
2. **Expanded Content Not Displaying**: Toggling to Expanded Content view showed an empty area
3. **Alt+C Shortcut Issue**: The Alt+C shortcut was not consistently copying the expanded content

## Implementation Details

### Auto-save Fix
- Modified the `handleEditorChange()` function to always use the more reliable API method for saving
- Removed the WebSocket-based saving that was causing inconsistent behavior
- Made sure changes are saved with a 1-second debounce to prevent too many API calls

### Expanded Content Display Fix
- Updated the `updateExpandedView()` function to always use the API fallback method
- Removed the unreliable WebSocket-based expansion that was causing empty content display
- Ensured the expanded content area has the correct background color

### Alt+C Keyboard Shortcut Fix
- Rewrote the `copyPromptContent()` function to always provide expanded content
- Added a new helper function `copyToClipboard()` to improve code organization
- Added logic to fetch expanded content on demand when copying even if not in expanded view
- Implemented proper fallback for cases where expansion might fail

## Files Modified
- `/home/jem/development/prompt_manager/src/templates/prompt_editor.html`

## Benefits
- The prompt editor now reliably saves changes automatically
- Expanded content view properly displays the rendered content with all inclusions expanded
- The Alt+C keyboard shortcut consistently copies the expanded content regardless of which view is active
