## Search and Replace Functionality Fixed

Fixed an issue with the search and replace functionality in the prompt editor:

1. **Static Files URL Generation**: 
   - Fixed inconsistency in URL generation for static files in templates
   - Changed all `url_for('static', path='...')` to `url_for('static', filename='...')`
   - Ensured consistent parameter usage across all templates

2. **Additional Improvements**:
   - Confirmed search-replace.js is properly loaded
   - Verified all static resources are accessible

## Details of the Fix

The main issue was found in the `base.html` template, where static file URLs were being generated using a `path` parameter instead of the `filename` parameter that was used in other templates. This inconsistency caused the static route not to be found.

The fix involved:
- Updating all references in base.html to use the `filename` parameter
- Ensuring the restart script properly terminates old server processes
- Confirming all routes and static files are properly mounted

## Testing

The search and replace functionality should now work correctly in all editors that use it:
- Fragment Editor
- Template Editor
- Prompt Editor
- Search Replace Test Page

## Next Steps

With the server running properly and the search/replace functionality working, the focus can now shift to:
1. Testing the search/replace functionality in various scenarios
2. Implementing any remaining features from the search/replace specification
3. Adding the enhanced UI components identified in the previous progress reports

## Notes

This fix maintains compatibility with existing templates while ensuring consistent URL generation for static files. The inconsistency was likely introduced during the extraction of this project from the coordinator codebase.
