# Progress Update - May 11, 2025

## Overview
This update focuses on addressing several issues that appeared after extracting the prompt manager from the coordinator project. Three specific issues were identified and fixed to make the prompt manager function as a standalone application.

## 1. Fixed Template Path Issue

### Issue
The application was encountering an error when trying to render templates:
```
{"detail":"Error rendering home page: 'index.html' not found in search path: 'src/coordinator/prompts/templates'"}
```

This occurred because after extracting the prompt manager from the coordinator project, the application was still looking for templates in the old path structure.

### Solution
1. Updated the template path in `src/api/session_routes.py` from:
   ```python
   templates = Jinja2Templates(directory="src/coordinator/prompts/templates")
   ```
   to:
   ```python
   templates = Jinja2Templates(directory="src/templates")
   ```

## 2. Fixed YAML Parsing Warnings

### Issue
The application was generating YAML parsing warnings when loading prompt files with serialized PromptType objects:
```
Error parsing front matter in /home/jem/.prompt_manager/prompts/system_prompt.md: could not determine a constructor for the tag 'tag:yaml.org,2002:python/object/apply:models.unified_prompt.PromptType'
```

### Solution
1. Enhanced the `load_prompt` method in `services/prompt_service.py` to better handle different serialized formats of PromptType
2. Updated the `save_prompt` method to store PromptType as a string value instead of an enum to avoid serialization issues
3. Fixed the existing prompt files in the user's config directory by updating:
   - `/home/jem/.prompt_manager/prompts/system_prompt.md` 
   - `/home/jem/.prompt_manager/prompts/user_prompt.md`
   - `/home/jem/.prompt_manager/prompts/project_start.md`

The front matter format was changed from:
```yaml
type: !!python/object/apply:models.unified_prompt.PromptType
- system
```
to a simpler:
```yaml
type: system
```

## 3. Eliminated Coordinator Dependencies

### Issue
The application had several dependencies on the original coordinator project, including:
- References to the coordinator API in session_routes.py
- Missing service functions that were formerly part of the coordinator project
- Import paths that still referenced the coordinator project structure
- Startup code in app.py that tried to import coordinator modules

### Solution
1. Created a stub `services/session` module to replace the coordinator session service:
   - Created a SessionService class with basic session management functionality
   - Implemented a get_session_service() function for dependency injection

2. Updated prompt_dirs.py to include all required functions:
   - Added get_directory_by_path function
   - Added get_default_directory function 
   - Enhanced initialize_prompt_directories function

3. Updated session_routes.py to use the new session services:
   - Changed API_BASE_URL from "http://localhost:8000/api" to "http://127.0.0.1:8081/api"
   - Updated imports to use the local session service

4. Updated app.py to remove coordinator references:
   - Changed FastAPI app title and description
   - Updated import paths
   - Fixed the uvicorn run command to use the local app path

## Additional Improvements
- Added better error handling in the prompt service to gracefully handle YAML parsing errors
- Created more comprehensive logging for debugging
- Updated import paths throughout the codebase for consistency
- Created a separate file for prompt directory management functions

## Next Steps
1. Test all functionality to ensure the prompt manager works independently
2. Update references to "Coordinator" in the UI to "Prompt Manager"
3. Enhance the session management functionality to fully replace the coordinator integration
4. Add unit tests for the new session service
