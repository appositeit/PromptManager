# Progress Update - May 17, 2025 (Search and Replace Functionality)

## Overview

Based on requirements, I'm implementing a search and replace function for the prompt editor that will:

1. Only be available in the "Raw Content" view
2. Support regex functionality in both search and replace fields
3. Progressively highlight matches as users type in the search box
4. Progressively show substitutions as users type in the replace box
5. Make changes permanent when the Replace button is clicked or Enter is pressed
6. Cancel changes when the Cancel button is clicked or Escape is pressed
7. Be accessible via Alt+R keyboard shortcut

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create a Search/Replace Dialog Component:**
   - Build a modal dialog with search and replace input fields
   - Add regex option toggle
   - Include Replace, Replace All, and Cancel buttons
   - Implement keyboard shortcuts (Enter for replace, Escape for cancel)

2. **Integrate with CodeMirror:**
   - Implement search functionality using CodeMirror's search addon
   - Integrate regex search capabilities
   - Add real-time highlighting of matches
   - Implement preview of replacement text

3. **UI Modifications:**
   - Add search/replace button to the editor toolbar
   - Implement Alt+R keyboard shortcut
   - Ensure the search/replace functionality is only available in raw content view

4. **Testing:**
   - Test with various search patterns, including regex
   - Verify highlighting works correctly
   - Test replacement preview works as expected
   - Confirm keyboard shortcuts work properly

## Technical Details

The implementation will leverage CodeMirror's built-in search functionality but extend it with:
1. A custom UI for better user experience
2. Live preview of replacements
3. Improved regex support
4. Integration with the editor's existing tab system

Because CodeMirror already has a search addon, we'll be building on solid foundations rather than implementing search/replace from scratch.

## Expected Benefits

1. **Improved Editing Efficiency:**
   - Quick search and replace will save time when editing large prompts
   - Regex support enables powerful pattern-based replacements

2. **Better User Experience:**
   - Real-time highlighting helps users understand what will be replaced
   - Preview of substitutions reduces errors
   - Keyboard shortcuts improve workflow efficiency

3. **Enhanced Functionality:**
   - The new feature brings the editor closer to professional text editing tools
   - Regex support enables advanced text manipulation
