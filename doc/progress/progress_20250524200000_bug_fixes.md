# Progress: Prompt Manager Bug Fixes - COMPLETE

**Date:** Saturday, May 24, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Both critical bugs fixed  
**Branch:** `prompt-id-uniqueness-fix`

## 🎯 Problems Solved

### Issue 1: Constant Server Reloading
The prompt manager server was constantly restarting and reloading prompts, causing:
- Main page failed to render properly
- Unstable service behavior  
- Poor user experience

**Root Cause:** `uvicorn.run()` was configured with `reload=True` in `src/server.py`

### Issue 2: Prompts with Spaces in IDs Not Loading
Prompts with spaces in their filenames (e.g., "install Google Calendar MCP.md") couldn't be accessed via the web interface, causing 404 errors.

**Root Cause:** The system converts spaces to underscores in prompt IDs during loading, but the web interface couldn't handle URLs with spaces in them.

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Server Reload Issue**
**File:** `src/server.py`
```python
# Before:
uvicorn.run("src.server:app", host=host, port=port, log_level=log_level, reload=True)

# After:  
uvicorn.run("src.server:app", host=host, port=port, log_level=log_level, reload=False)
```

### 2. **Added Space-to-Underscore Normalization**

**File:** `src/server.py` - Web interface route:
```python
@app.get("/prompts/{prompt_id:path}", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def prompt_editor(request: Request, prompt_id: str):
    # Try to find the prompt directly first
    prompt_object = prompt_service_instance.get_prompt(path_param_id)
    
    # If not found and the ID contains spaces, try converting spaces to underscores
    if not prompt_object and ' ' in path_param_id:
        normalized_id = path_param_id.replace(' ', '_')
        prompt_object = prompt_service_instance.get_prompt(normalized_id)
        if prompt_object:
            # Redirect to the correct URL to normalize the URL structure
            return RedirectResponse(url=f"/prompts/{normalized_id}", status_code=301)
```

**File:** `src/api/router.py` - API route:
```python
@router.get("/{prompt_id:path}", response_model=Dict)
async def get_prompt_by_id(prompt_id: str, directory: Optional[str] = None, ...):
    prompt = prompt_service.get_prompt(prompt_id, directory)
    
    # If not found and the ID contains spaces, try converting spaces to underscores
    if not prompt and ' ' in prompt_id:
        normalized_id = prompt_id.replace(' ', '_')
        prompt = prompt_service.get_prompt(normalized_id, directory)
```

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Server Stability Test
```bash
./bin/restart_prompt_manager.sh
# ✅ Result: Server starts once, stays stable
# ✅ No constant reloading in logs
# ✅ Main page renders correctly
```

### Spaces in URLs Test
```bash
# Test API with spaces (URL encoded)
curl -s "http://localhost:8095/api/prompts/prompts/install%20Google%20Calendar%20MCP"
# ✅ Result: Returns prompt data correctly

# Test web interface with spaces
curl -L "http://localhost:8095/prompts/prompts/install%20Google%20Calendar%20MCP"
# ✅ Result: Redirects to underscore version and loads editor
```

### Redirect Behavior Test
```bash
curl -v "http://localhost:8095/prompts/prompts/install%20Google%20Calendar%20MCP" 2>&1 | grep HTTP
# ✅ Result: HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
# ✅ Redirects to: /prompts/prompts/install_Google_Calendar_MCP
```

## 📋 How the Fix Works

### ID Normalization Strategy
1. **File Loading:** Spaces in filenames are converted to underscores in prompt IDs during loading
2. **Direct Access:** URLs with underscores work immediately  
3. **Space Handling:** URLs with spaces are detected and normalized
4. **Redirect:** Web interface redirects space URLs to underscore URLs (SEO-friendly)
5. **API Compatibility:** API accepts both formats and returns data

### User Experience
- **Legacy URLs:** Old URLs with spaces continue to work
- **Clean URLs:** System normalizes to underscore format
- **No Breaking Changes:** Existing functionality preserved
- **Better Performance:** No constant server reloading

## 🔍 Files Modified

1. **`src/server.py`**
   - Disabled uvicorn reload
   - Added space normalization and redirect in web route

2. **`src/api/router.py`**  
   - Added space normalization in API route

## 🚀 Status Summary

**Both critical bugs resolved:**

- ✅ **Server Stability:** No more constant reloading - service runs stably
- ✅ **Space Handling:** Prompts with spaces in filenames accessible via web and API  
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility:** Existing URLs continue to work
- ✅ **User Experience:** Clean redirects, stable interface
- ✅ **Performance:** Faster loading, no unnecessary restarts

## 📋 Ready for Production

The prompt manager is now fully operational with:
- Stable server behavior
- Complete prompt accessibility regardless of filename spaces
- Proper URL normalization  
- Robust error handling
- Backward compatibility

**System is ready for normal operation on both mie and nara.**
