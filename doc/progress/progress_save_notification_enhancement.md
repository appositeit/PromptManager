# Save Notification Enhancement

## Problem

The current prompt manager shows too many toaster notifications, especially for save operations. These can be distracting when working with the editor as the save operation happens frequently.

## Solution

We've replaced the toast notifications for save operations with a subtle visual indicator directly on the Save button. Now when a save occurs:

1. The Save button temporarily changes to show "Saved" along with a checkmark icon.
2. After a short delay (1.5 seconds), the button reverts to its original state.
3. The color of the button also changes temporarily to provide a clear but non-distracting visual cue.

We've implemented this for both manual saves (when the user clicks the Save button) and auto-saves (triggered after a period of inactivity).

## Implementation Details

- Modified both `prompt_editor.html` and `template_editor.html` files to implement the new save indication pattern.
- Refactored the save functions to return promises to better manage the button state changes.
- Updated the toast notification system to skip notifications for successful saves while still showing them for error conditions.
- Added auto-save functionality to the template editor to match the behavior of the prompt editor.
- Added improved error handling to reset button states appropriately when errors occur.
- Set fixed minimum widths for save buttons to prevent UI elements from shifting when button text changes.
- Ensured consistent button text lengths between different states ("Save", "Saving", "Saved") to maintain UI stability.

## Benefits

- Reduced notification noise leads to a better user experience.
- The save indication is still clear but much less distracting.
- The visual feedback is immediate and located exactly where the user is looking (on the Save button).
- Consistent behavior across both editors improves the overall user experience.
- Auto-saving in both editors ensures work is not lost.
