# Progress Update: Reordered Directory Table Columns

## Change Description
Reordered the columns in the Directories table to move the Status column between the Name and Path columns. This provides better visibility for the enable/disable status of directories and makes the user interface more intuitive.

## Implementation Details
1. Updated the table header to reorder the column titles
2. Reordered the cells in the row creation JavaScript code to match the new column order
3. Maintained all existing functionality for the directories table

## Files Modified
- `/home/jem/development/prompt_manager/src/templates/manage_prompts.html`

## UI Improvements
The new column order provides a more logical layout where the Status column (which shows if a directory is enabled or disabled) is prominently placed next to the directory name, making it easier for users to see which directories are active at a glance.
