# Progress Update: Fixed Directory Status Toggle Functionality

## Change Description
Fixed the directory status toggle functionality that allows users to enable/disable directories from the Directories table. When a directory is disabled, its prompts are no longer shown in the Prompts table.

## Issue
The toggle functionality was broken due to a JavaScript name collision between the imported function from `directory_manager.js` and the locally defined function in the manage_prompts.html template. This caused the toggle action to fail silently.

## Implementation Details
1. Renamed the local function from `toggleDirectoryStatus` to `handleToggleDirectoryStatus` to avoid the naming conflict
2. Updated the event listener to call the renamed function
3. Enhanced the CSS styling of the status badge to make it more obvious that it's a clickable element:
   - Added padding and border-radius
   - Added hover and active states for better feedback
   - Added transition effects for a more polished UI

## Files Modified
- `/home/jem/development/prompt_manager/src/templates/manage_prompts.html`

## How to Use
Users can now click on the "Enabled" or "Disabled" badge in the Status column of the Directories table to toggle a directory's status. When a directory is disabled, its prompts will be automatically filtered out from the Prompts table.
