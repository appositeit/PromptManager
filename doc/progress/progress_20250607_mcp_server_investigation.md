# Progress Update: MCP Server Investigation and Status

**Date:** 2025-06-07
**Thread ID:** i9879

## Investigation Summary

After thorough investigation of the prompt_manager codebase, I found that:

### What Exists
1. **MCP Server Management System** - Complete infrastructure for managing external MCP servers:
   - `src/models/mcp.py` - Data models for MCP server configs and tools
   - `src/services/mcp.py` - Service layer for managing MCP server configurations
   - `src/api/mcp_router.py` - REST API endpoints for MCP server management
   - `src/templates/mcp_servers.html` - UI for MCP server management
   - Integration into main FastAPI server (`src/server.py`)

2. **Key Features of Current System:**
   - Server registration and configuration
   - Session-based MCP server assignments to different AI roles
   - Tool-level access control per server
   - Status monitoring and health checks
   - UI for managing server configurations

### What's Missing
**No standalone MCP server implementation was found.** The current system is designed to connect to and manage external MCP servers but doesn't include the actual MCP server that would:
- Expose prompt management functionality via MCP protocol
- Provide tools for prompt CRUD operations
- Handle prompt expansion and validation
- Expose directory management capabilities

### Search Results
- No `mcp_server` directory found in current codebase
- No traces in git history of a deleted standalone MCP server
- No Python classes implementing actual MCP server protocol
- Serena MCP system is already activated (`.serena` directory exists)

## Conclusion
The missing MCP server needs to be rebuilt from scratch. The existing management infrastructure provides a solid foundation for integration, but we need to implement:

1. **Standalone MCP Server** - A server that implements the MCP protocol
2. **Prompt Manager Tools** - MCP tools that expose prompt management functionality
3. **Integration Layer** - Connection between the standalone MCP server and existing prompt management services

## Next Steps
1. Implement standalone MCP server with MCP protocol support
2. Create MCP tools for prompt management operations
3. Integrate with existing MCP server management system
4. Test end-to-end functionality

## Technical Notes
- Current system expects MCP servers to run on ports like 8082
- Default server configuration exists pointing to localhost:8082
- UI and API infrastructure ready for immediate integration
- PromptService system is well-established and ready for MCP exposure
