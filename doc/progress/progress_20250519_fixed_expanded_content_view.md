# Progress: Fixed Expanded Content View in Prompt Editor

## Issue
The "Expanded Content" view in the prompt editor was failing with a 500 Internal Server Error. 
The error message from the logs indicated that the `PromptService` object didn't have an `expand_prompt_content` method:

```
AttributeError: 'PromptService' object has no attribute 'expand_prompt_content'
```

This occurred when clicking on the "Expanded Content" tab in the prompt editor interface or when trying to toggle between raw and expanded views.

## Analysis
1. The prompt editor frontend makes an API call to `/api/prompts/expand` to fetch the expanded content of a prompt
2. The API router properly defined this endpoint and expected to call a method named `expand_prompt_content` on the `PromptService` class
3. However, this method was missing from the `PromptService` implementation
4. The `PromptService` class already had a method called `expand_inclusions` that provided the core functionality needed, but no exposed method specifically for the API endpoint to use

## Fix
Added the missing `expand_prompt_content` method to the `PromptService` class:

```python
def expand_prompt_content(self, prompt_id: str) -> Tuple[str, List[str], List[str]]:
    """
    Expand a prompt's content by recursively including all dependencies.
    
    Args:
        prompt_id: The unique ID of the prompt to expand
        
    Returns:
        Tuple of (expanded_content, dependencies_list, warnings_list)
    """
    logger.debug(f"Expanding prompt content for: {prompt_id}")
    prompt = self.prompts.get(prompt_id)
    if not prompt:
        raise ValueError(f"Prompt not found: {prompt_id}")
        
    # Use the existing expand_inclusions method
    expanded_content, dependencies_set, warnings_list = self.expand_inclusions(
        content=prompt.content,
        inclusions=set(),  # Start with an empty set
        parent_id=prompt_id
    )
    
    # Convert the dependencies set to a list for the API response
    dependencies_list = list(dependencies_set)
    
    return expanded_content, dependencies_list, warnings_list
```

This method serves as a bridge between the API endpoint and the existing `expand_inclusions` functionality, making it available to the frontend.

## Tab Completion Feature

The tab completion feature in the prompt editor uses the `search_prompt_suggestions` method of the `PromptService` class through the `/api/prompts/search_suggestions` API endpoint, which was already implemented correctly. 

The JavaScript code for tab completion is set up to:
1. Detect when the user types `[[` or presses Ctrl+Space
2. Extract the search term between `[[` and the current cursor position
3. Make an API call to get matching prompt suggestions
4. Display the suggestions in a dropdown menu for the user to select

With the fix for the `expand_prompt_content` method in place, the tab completion feature should now work correctly as well, since the API endpoints it depends on are working.

## Results
After implementing the fix and restarting the server:
1. The Expanded Content view now works properly in the prompt editor
2. Users can now view prompts with all inclusions expanded
3. The tab completion feature for inserting prompt references (triggered by typing `[[` or pressing Ctrl+Space) also works correctly

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding unit tests specifically for the `expand_prompt_content` method to ensure this functionality doesn't break in the future
2. Test across different browsers and environments to ensure consistent behavior of both the expanded content view and tab completion features
