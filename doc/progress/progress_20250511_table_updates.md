# Progress Update - May 11, 2025 - Table Improvements

## Directory Column and Stable Sorting for Tables

### Overview
This update adds a directory column as the first column in all prompt management tables and implements stable sorting to ensure consistent sorting behavior. The changes apply to the prompt templates, fragments, and prompts management pages.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added Directory Column to Tables
- Added a directory column as the first column in the prompts table
- Added a directory column as the first column in the fragments table
- Added a directory column as the first column in the templates table
- Updated the column CSS styling to accommodate the new column

#### 2. Implemented Stable Sort Algorithm
- Added a `stableSort` utility function to all table JavaScript code
- Modified the sorting logic to use the stable sort algorithm
- Ensured the sort maintains the original order of elements when sort keys are equal
- Updated the default sort to use the directory column first

#### 3. Enhanced Sorting UI
- Added sort indicators to all sortable columns
- Added visual feedback when a column is being sorted
- Implemented bidirectional sorting (ascending/descending toggle)
- Made sorting work for various data types (strings, dates, numbers)

#### 4. Added Template Directory Selection
- Added directory selection in the new template modal
- Ensures templates can be properly organized by directory

### Benefits
1. **Improved Organization**: The directory column provides clear visibility of where each prompt, fragment, or template is stored
2. **Predictable Sorting**: The stable sort algorithm ensures consistent sorting behavior even when elements have equal sort keys
3. **Enhanced Navigation**: Users can now easily identify and group items by directory

### Technical Implementation
- Used the `stableSort` algorithm that preserves the original order of equal elements
- Added CSS styling to ensure optimal display of the directory column
- Updated the row creation code to include the directory column
- Added error handling for date formatting in case of invalid dates

### Next Steps
1. Consider adding directory filtering options to allow users to filter by specific directories
2. Add a configuration option to hide/show the directory column based on user preference
3. Consider implementing persistent sort settings that save the user's preferred sort across sessions
