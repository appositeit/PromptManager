# Progress Update: Fixed Expanded Content View Scrolling

## Issue
The expanded content view had a scrollable box with its own scrollbar, preventing normal page scrolling with the mouse wheel. This created a poor user experience as users had to use the scrollbar instead of just scrolling the page normally.

## Fix
Modified the CSS and JavaScript to remove the inner scrollbar and allow content to flow naturally:

1. Changed the preview container to use `overflow: visible` instead of `auto`
2. Removed code that was setting explicit height based on content size
3. Used `height: auto !important` to ensure the container grows with its content
4. Added styles for code blocks and other markdown elements to ensure proper display
5. Set `min-height: auto` to remove constraints that were causing the scrollbar

## Files Modified
- `/home/jem/development/prompt_manager/src/templates/prompt_editor.html`

These changes ensure that the expanded content view behaves like a normal page element, allowing users to scroll the entire page with their mouse wheel instead of being trapped in a scrollable box.
