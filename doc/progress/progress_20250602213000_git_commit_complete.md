## Key Features Added

### **1. Isolated Test Infrastructure**
- **IsolatedPromptService:** Prevents test interference with production directories
- **TestPromptsHelper:** Utility class for managing test prompt workflows
- **Dependency Override System:** Clean separation of test and production services

### **2. Test Prompt Repository**
- **5 Test Prompts:** Covering simple, composite, tagged, and dependency scenarios
- **Known Test Data:** Predictable prompt content for reliable testing
- **Relationship Mapping:** Clear documentation of prompt dependencies

### **3. Enhanced Integration Testing**

- **Isolated Client:** TestClient configured with test-only prompt service
- **Workflow Tests:** End-to-end testing with controlled test data

## Technical Benefits

### **Testing Reliability**
- ✅ Tests no longer depend on or modify production prompt directories
- ✅ Predictable test data enables reliable assertion writing
- ✅ Isolated environment prevents test pollution

### **Development Workflow**
- ✅ Safe to run tests without affecting working prompts
- ✅ Consistent test results across different development environments
- ✅ Clear separation between test and production code paths

### **Future Extensibility**
- ✅ Foundation for more complex integration test scenarios
- ✅ Template for adding new test prompt types
- ✅ Reusable fixtures for other test files
