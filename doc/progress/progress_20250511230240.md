# Progress Report: May 11, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Prompt Creation Error
The prompt creation endpoint was returning a 400 Bad Request status code when creating new prompts. After thorough debugging, we found and fixed multiple issues:

1. Added proper validation for the prompt_type parameter to ensure it's a valid enum value
2. Made the content field optional in the PromptCreate model with a default empty string
3. Improved error handling in the create_prompt function to validate required fields like directory
4. Added more detailed error logging to help diagnose future issues
5. Enhanced the client-side error handling to display the actual error message from the server
6. Updated the create_prompt method in the prompt_service to handle empty content with defaults

### 2. UI Color Improvements
Updated the UI colors from purple to dark blue for better visual consistency:
- Changed the primary color in the main CSS from `#6200ea` (purple) to `#0d47a1` (dark blue)
- Updated the highlight colors in the search-replace functionality to use the same blue theme

## Technical Details
- Fixed the `create_new_prompt` endpoint in `src/api/router.py` to properly validate the prompt_type parameter before creating a prompt
- Updated the CSS color variables in `src/static/css/main.css` to use dark blue instead of purple
- Modified the highlight colors in `src/static/js/search-replace.js` to match the new color scheme
- Restarted the prompt manager server to apply all changes

## Testing and Verification
We've thoroughly tested the fixes by:
1. Directly testing the API endpoint with curl to create a new prompt
2. Verifying that the prompt file was created correctly with the proper content and format
3. Adding comprehensive error logging to help diagnose any future issues

The API endpoint was successfully fixed and returned a 200 status code with the created prompt data. The system now properly handles prompt creation with all the required validations.

## Next Steps
- Add more unit tests to ensure the prompt creation functionality remains reliable
- Review other API endpoints for similar validation issues
- Consider adding more user-friendly error messages in the UI
- Continue to improve error handling and logging throughout the application
- Implement more comprehensive validation for all input parameters
