# Progress Update: Prompt Editor JavaScript Error Fix

**Date:** 2025-06-01 21:12
**Issue:** Prompt editor page was not loading the CodeMirror editor
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem Description

After implementing the "New Prompt" functionality on the prompt editor page, the editor stopped working completely. The page would load but the CodeMirror editor area would be empty, preventing any editing functionality.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by a JavaScript variable name conflict:

1. **Global Variable Declaration:** The `new_prompt_modal.js` file declares a global variable:
   ```javascript
   let newPromptModal = null;
   ```

2. **Template Variable Declaration:** The prompt editor template also declared:
   ```javascript
   let newPromptModal = null;
   ```

3. **Conflict Result:** This caused a "duplicate declaration" error since `let` cannot redeclare the same variable in the same scope, preventing the entire script block from executing.

## Additional Issues Found & Fixed

1. **Forward Reference Problem:** The `window.promptHint` function was being referenced in `initializeEditor()` before it was defined, moved the definition earlier in the script.

2. **DOMContentLoaded Timing:** The original code assumed the DOMContentLoaded event hadn't fired yet, but sometimes the script loads after the DOM is ready, added conditional logic to handle both cases.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Variable Name Conflict Resolution
- Changed the local variable in the prompt editor template from `newPromptModal` to `editorNewPromptModal`
- Updated all references accordingly

### 2. Function Order Fix
- Moved `window.promptHint` function definition before `initializeEditor()` to resolve forward reference

### 3. DOM Ready State Handling
- Added conditional logic to execute initialization immediately if DOM is already loaded:
```javascript
if (document.readyState === 'loading') {
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initializePromptEditor);
} else {
    initializePromptEditor();
}
```

## Testing Results

✅ **Prompt Editor Loading:** CodeMirror editor now loads correctly and displays content
✅ **New Prompt Button:** "New Prompt" button works in prompt editor context  
✅ **Create in New Tab:** New functionality works as expected
✅ **Directory Default:** Modal correctly defaults to current prompt's directory
✅ **E2E Tests:** Basic functionality tests pass
✅ **All Features:** Save, copy, rename, delete, toggle view all functional

## Files Modified

- `src/templates/prompt_editor.html` - Fixed variable conflict and initialization logic
- No changes to `src/static/js/new_prompt_modal.js` (conflict was in template)

## Verification

The prompt editor now works correctly with all requested features:
- ✅ New Prompt button with shortcut Alt+N
- ✅ "Create in new tab" button with Ctrl+Shift+Enter shortcut
- ✅ Default directory field populated with current directory
- ✅ Hover text shows keyboard shortcuts
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

## Lessons Learned

1. **Variable Naming:** Be careful with global vs local variable names when including external JS files
2. **Script Execution Order:** Always check function dependencies and define functions before use
3. **DOM Timing:** Handle both early and late script execution scenarios
4. **Error Debugging:** JavaScript syntax errors can be subtle and prevent entire script blocks from executing

This fix ensures the prompt editor remains fully functional while adding the requested "New Prompt" capabilities.
