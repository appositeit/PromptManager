## Prompt Manager Bug Fix

Fixed an issue related to removing `prompt_type` references from the codebase. The problem was that several files still referenced the `prompt_type` attribute that was removed from the unified prompt model:

1. In `websocket_routes.py`, the following issues were resolved:
   - Removed references to `prompt_type` in the initial WebSocket data payload
   - Removed `prompt_type` handling in the metadata update action
   - Added `is_composite` property in place of `prompt_type` where appropriate
   
2. Also fixed a parameter name mismatch in various places:
   - Changed `root_id` to `parent_id` in multiple files to match the function signature in the PromptService class
   
These changes fixed the following errors:
- "Error sending initial data: 'Prompt' object has no attribute 'prompt_type'"
- "TypeError: PromptService.expand_inclusions() got an unexpected keyword argument 'root_id'"

The server is now running properly with all features working correctly:
- WebSocket connections for real-time prompt editing
- Prompt expansion functionality
- Web interface for managing prompts

## Next Steps
Continue to look for any remaining issues with the `prompt_type` removal, especially in any client-side JavaScript that might still be expecting this property.
