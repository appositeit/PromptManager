# Progress Update - May 18, 2025 (Template Caching Fix)

## Issue Identified

The Prompt Manager has been experiencing an issue with template rendering due to Jinja2 template caching. This causes changes to templates not to be reflected immediately unless the server is restarted.

## Solution

After examining the code, I found that there was already a configuration in place to disable Jinja2 template caching:

```python
# Create custom Jinja2 environment with caching disabled
env = Environment(
    loader=FileSystemLoader(templates_dir),
    cache_size=0,  # Disable caching
    auto_reload=True  # Auto reload templates
)
```

However, I've enhanced this solution to ensure it's properly applied:

1. Verified the Jinja2 environment configuration is correct
2. Added a template loader force-refresh mechanism 
3. Ensured the environment is properly passed to the templates

## Changes Made

- Enhanced the Jinja2 environment configuration to guarantee template refreshing
- Added debug logging for template loading to help diagnose any remaining issues
- Set more explicit cache control headers in HTTP responses
- Added an additional template cache clearing step on each template render

## Next Steps

1. Test the solution to ensure templates are now reloading correctly
2. Monitor for any performance impact from disabling caching
3. Consider adding a development/production toggle for template caching in the future (keep caching enabled in production for performance)
