# Progress: Fixed Tab Completion Functionality

## Issue
Tab completion in the prompt editor was failing with a 404 Not Found error. When typing `[[` or pressing Ctrl+Space to trigger autocompletion for prompt references, the browser console showed:

```
[PromptHint] Search term determined: 'p'
GET http://localhost:8081/api/prompts/search_suggestions?query=p&exclude=overview 404 (Not Found)
```

This prevented users from easily inserting references to other prompts, which is a key feature for composite prompts.

## Root Cause
The API router correctly defined the `/api/prompts/search_suggestions` endpoint, but there was a route ordering issue in FastAPI:

1. In FastAPI, routes are matched in the order they're defined
2. The `/{prompt_id}` route was defined before the `/search_suggestions` route
3. This caused any request to `/search_suggestions` to be captured by the `/{prompt_id}` route, with FastAPI treating "search_suggestions" as a prompt ID
4. The logs confirmed this by showing: `Prompt ID 'search_suggestions' not found by any method. Returning None.`

## Fix Implemented
Moved the `/search_suggestions` route to be defined before the `/{prompt_id}` route in the router:

```python
# Define specific routes before parameter routes
@router.get("/search_suggestions", response_model=List[Dict])
async def get_prompt_suggestions(
    query: str,
    exclude: Optional[str] = None,
    prompt_service: PromptServiceClass = Depends(get_prompt_service_dependency)
):
    """Get prompt suggestions for autocompletion based on a query string."""
    logger.info(f"Searching suggestions for query: '{query}', excluding: '{exclude}'")
    try:
        suggestions = prompt_service.search_prompt_suggestions(query, exclude)
        return suggestions 
    except Exception as e:
        logger.opt(exception=True).error(f"Error searching prompt suggestions: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Internal server error while searching prompt suggestions")

# Dynamic parameter route should come after all specific routes
@router.get("/{prompt_id}", response_model=Dict)
async def get_prompt_by_id(prompt_id: str, directory: Optional[str] = None, ...):
    # ... implementation ...
```

The key change was repositioning the route in the router file to ensure proper routing precedence in FastAPI.

## Results
- Tab completion now works correctly in the prompt editor
- Users can type `[[` followed by letters to see a dropdown of matching prompts
- Pressing Ctrl+Space also triggers the autocompletion menu
- Selecting a suggestion properly inserts the prompt reference with closing brackets `]]`

## Next Steps
- Consider adding a test specifically for the tab completion feature
- Enhance the tab completion to show additional information about the prompts (e.g., description, directory) in the dropdown
- Improve the frontend error handling for when the API request fails
- Consider using FastAPI's path parameter constraints (like regex) to make the routing more robust
