"""
Progress update for WebSocket debugging and implementation.
"""

## Current Status

We've been working on implementing and debugging the WebSocket functionality in the prompt manager. The WebSocket API is designed to enable real-time collaborative editing of prompts and fragments.

## Issues Encountered

We've encountered several issues with the WebSocket implementation:

1. WebSocket connections are being rejected with HTTP 400 Bad Request errors
2. CORS-related issues may be preventing WebSocket connections
3. The original WebSocket routes are not properly recognized by the server

## Progress Made

1. Identified that the WebSocket routes were not being properly imported and registered with the FastAPI app
2. Added middleware to handle WebSocket CORS headers
3. Created proper debug tools to diagnose WebSocket connection issues
4. Updated WebSocket route definitions to improve compatibility

## Next Steps

1. Implement a proper solution for WebSocket connections, possibly using a dedicated WebSocket server module
2. Test with browser-like headers and connection setup
3. Add appropriate logging to better understand connection issues
4. Ensure CORS headers are correctly set for WebSocket connections

## Potential Solutions

1. Use a separate WebSocket server module that's specifically configured for WebSocket connections
2. Add more detailed debugging and logging to identify the exact cause of the 400 errors
3. Review FastAPI's handling of WebSocket connections to ensure we're following best practices
4. Test with different client configurations to identify client-side issues

## Implementation Plan

We'll create a new WebSocket implementation that uses a simpler approach with explicit CORS handling and improved error reporting. This will help isolate and fix the issues with the current implementation.
