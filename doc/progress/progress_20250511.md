# Prompt Manager Progress Update - 2025-05-11

## Project Status
The Prompt Manager project has been created as a standalone application, extracted from the Coordinator project. The initial setup involves minimal changes to make the existing code work in its new context.

## Completed Tasks
- Created project directory structure
- Set up configuration files
- Created run scripts with proper paths
- Updated imports to reflect the new project structure
- Created setup and restart scripts

## Next Steps
- Test the application to ensure it runs correctly
- Evaluate and update the database/storage system for prompts
- Simplify the API if needed (remove unused endpoints)
- Improve documentation and UI
- Add unit tests

## Issues/Challenges
- Need to ensure all imports and path references are updated correctly
- May need to refactor some components that were tightly coupled with the original Coordinator project
