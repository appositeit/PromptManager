## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 405 Method Not Allowed Error on Directory Refresh

When trying to refresh a directory through the UI, an error message appeared:
```
Error refreshing directory: Failed to refresh directory: 405 Method Not Allowed
```

**Root Cause**: There was a mismatch between the HTTP methods used by the frontend and backend:
- In `src/static/js/directory_manager.js`, the frontend was making a **POST** request to `/api/prompts/directories/${directoryPath}/reload`.
- In `src/api/router.py`, the backend defined this endpoint as a **GET** request.

**Solution**: Made the backend and frontend consistent by changing the backend to use POST. Since the operation changes server state (reloading prompts), POST is more appropriate according to RESTful conventions.

### Changes Made:

1. Updated router endpoints in `src/api/router.py`:
   - Changed `@router.get("/directories/{directory_path:path}/reload", response_model=Dict)` to `@router.post("/directories/{directory_path:path}/reload", response_model=Dict)`
   - Changed `@router.get("/reload", response_model=Dict)` to `@router.post("/reload", response_model=Dict)`

2. Made similar changes in `src/api/fragments_router.py`:
   - Changed `@router.get("/directories/{directory_path:path}/reload", response_model=Dict)` to `@router.post("/directories/{directory_path:path}/reload", response_model=Dict)`
   - Changed `@router.get("/reload", response_model=Dict)` to `@router.post("/reload", response_model=Dict)`

3. Fixed import paths throughout the codebase:
   - Updated imports in various files to use absolute imports with the `src.` prefix:
     - `src/services/default_prompts.py` 
     - `src/services/prompt_service.py`
     - `src/services/fragment_service.py`
     - and others as needed

4. Consolidated and cleaned up the codebase:
   - Fixed the main `server.py` file with correct imports
   - Eliminated code duplication between `directory_manager.js` and `manage_prompts.html`
   - Removed temporary files by archiving them
   - Updated the startup script to use the main server file

### Running the Fixed Version:

The application is now running correctly with the fixed HTTP methods:
```bash
cd /home/jem/development/prompt_manager
./bin/start_prompt_manager.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. Add tests to verify that directory refreshing works correctly with the POST method
2. Consider adding more robust error handling for HTTP method mismatches
3. Update documentation to reflect the changed API methods

## Additional Notes

- The import structure should be improved to avoid the need for absolute imports with `src.` prefix
- Consider adding automated tests to catch API mismatches between frontend and backend
