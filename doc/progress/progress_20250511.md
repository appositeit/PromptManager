# Prompt Manager Progress Update - 2025-05-11

## Project Status
The Prompt Manager project has been successfully extracted from the Coordinator project and set up as a standalone application. The API endpoints for prompt management are now functioning correctly, but the web interface templates need to be fixed.

## Completed Tasks
- Created a complete project directory structure with proper organization
- Set up a virtual environment and installed dependencies
- Created run scripts with proper path handling
- Modified and updated imports to work with the new project structure
- Fixed paths and configuration to use a new `.prompt_manager` user config directory
- Set up logging with proper paths
- Created Git repository for version control
- Successfully loaded existing prompts

## Current Issues
- Template paths in the server.py file are not resolving correctly, causing a 500 error when accessing the web interface
- Some YAML loading errors for custom Python object types in the front matter of the prompts (these are non-blocking warnings)

## Next Steps
1. Fix the template path issue to get the web interface working
2. Update the templates to use the new project name and branding
3. Add unit tests for the core functionality
4. Create a proper setup.py file for installing as a package
5. Improve documentation with usage examples

## Testing
The API endpoints were tested and are functioning correctly:
- `/api/prompts/all` returns a list of all available prompts

The core prompt loading functionality works as expected, with all prompts being loaded successfully from the user config directory.

## Usage
To run the Prompt Manager:
```bash
cd /home/jem/development/prompt_manager
bin/start_prompt_manager.sh --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8082
```

This script will check for the existence of a virtual environment, create one if needed, and then run the server with the specified options.
