# Progress Update - May 11, 2025 (Template Caching Fix)

## Issue Resolved

The Prompt Manager was experiencing template rendering issues due to a problem with the custom Jinja2 template loader. The issue manifested as errors on page load with the specific error message: `'ForceReloadLoader' object has no attribute 'find_template'`.

## Root Cause

The root cause was identified in the `ForceReloadLoader` class that was implemented to ensure templates are always reloaded from disk, bypassing Jinja2's caching mechanism. The class had two implementation issues:

1. It was using `self._find_template(template)` method, but the method name was incorrect - the class didn't have this method.
2. It was also trying to use `self._load_template_source(filename)` which again was not properly implemented.

## Solution Implemented

The solution was to simplify the `ForceReloadLoader.get_source()` method to use the parent class's method directly but override the behavior of the `uptodate` function:

```python
def get_source(self, environment, template):
    """Get the template source, always forcing a reload from disk."""
    # Just use the parent class method directly for finding and loading the template
    source, filename, _ = super().get_source(environment, template)
    
    # Always return a new uptodate function that returns False
    # to force template reloading
    return source, filename, lambda: False
```

This approach:
1. Uses the parent `FileSystemLoader` class's implementation for finding and loading templates
2. Overrides the `uptodate` function to always return `False`, which forces Jinja2 to reload the template every time

## Testing

After implementing the fix, the server was restarted and successfully loaded all pages:
- The main page redirects to `/manage/prompts` as expected
- The `/manage/prompts` page loads correctly without errors
- Template changes will now be detected without requiring a server restart

## Future Improvements

For future consideration:
1. Add more comprehensive unit tests for the template loading mechanism
2. Consider adding a development/production toggle for template caching (keep caching enabled in production for performance)
3. Add more detailed logging for template loading and rendering to help diagnose any future issues
