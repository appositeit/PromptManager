# Prompt Manager Server Startup Debugging - May 13, 2025

## Summary

We've resolved an issue with server startup where the application wasn't properly handling the `--log-file` parameter, causing 404 errors on the API endpoints. The fix involved adding support for the `--log-file` parameter in server.py and implementing a more robust initialization process for the API routers, particularly handling the optional dependency on the 'coordinator' module.

## Identified Issues

1. Missing `--log-file` parameter in the server.py argument parser
2. The MCP router (mcp_router.py) was failing to load due to a missing 'coordinator' module dependency
3. These issues were preventing the proper initialization of API routes, causing 404 errors

## Changes Made

1. Added `--log-file` parameter to the server.py argument parser:
   ```python
   parser.add_argument("--log-file", type=str, default=None,
                       help="Path to log file to write to")
   ```

2. Implemented logging configuration when a log file is specified:
   ```python
   # Configure logging if a log file is specified
   if args.log_file:
       print(f"Logging to file: {args.log_file}")
       import logging
       logging.basicConfig(
           filename=args.log_file,
           level=logging.INFO,
           format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
       )
       # Also log uvicorn output
       logging.getLogger("uvicorn").setLevel(logging.INFO)
   ```

3. Improved the router import process to handle different import scenarios:
   - Split the import process to separate core routers from optional ones
   - Added fallback dummy implementations for the 'coordinator' module dependencies in mcp_router.py
   - Provided more descriptive error messages for troubleshooting

4. Kept the existing startup script (bin/start_prompt_manager.sh) unchanged, as it was already correctly configured.

## Verification

After implementing these changes, we verified that:

1. The server starts successfully with the `--log-file` parameter
2. The API endpoints return proper responses
3. The server can be accessed through its web interface

## Next Steps

1. Consider documenting the command-line parameters in the project documentation
2. Consider adding more robust error handling for startup scenarios
3. Consider adding integration tests that verify server startup with different command-line parameters
4. Continue monitoring the rename functionality for any potential edge cases

## Post-Fix Verification

We tested the rename functionality and confirmed it's working correctly:

1. Created a test prompt using the API: `/api/prompts/`
2. Renamed the prompt using: `/api/prompts/rename`
3. Verified the new prompt exists and the old one is gone
4. Checked the filesystem to confirm the file was properly renamed
5. Examined the file content to ensure metadata was preserved

The rename functionality is successfully renaming the prompt and its underlying file, updating references in the in-memory prompt dictionary, and maintaining all metadata.

## Lessons Learned

1. When debugging startup issues, focus on the application entry point first
2. Implement robust error handling for optional dependencies
3. Ensure all command-line parameters are properly documented and supported
4. Use dummy implementations for optional components to maintain core functionality
5. Keep the startup script consistent and avoid unnecessary modifications
