# Progress Update: Added Prompt Directory Display

## Change Description
Added the directory information to the prompt editor's metadata section, allowing users to quickly see where a prompt file is stored.

## Implementation
- Added a new text line in the metadata section of the prompt editor UI to display the directory path
- Updated the JavaScript code to populate this field from the prompt data when loading
- Used a semibold font weight to make the directory path more visible

## UI Improvements
The directory information is now clearly visible in the metadata section on the right side of the prompt editor, providing better context about the prompt's location within the file system.

## Files Modified
- `/home/jem/development/prompt_manager/src/templates/prompt_editor.html`
