# Progress Update: Startup Performance and Activity Data Automation

**Date**: 2025-06-07 16:15:00  
**Focus**: Improving ProjectCatalog startup performance and automating activity data loading

## Issues Identified

1. **Slow Startup Performance**
   - Currently the web server starts background threads (analysis worker, directory watcher, heartbeat monitor) immediately
   - Project analysis runs synchronously on startup, blocking UI responsiveness
   - Users experience delays before the UI becomes usable

2. **Manual Activity Data Loading**
   - Activity data requires manual refresh by clicking "Refresh Activity Data" button
   - This is frustrating since activity tracking is a core feature of ProjectCatalog
   - The `?refresh=true` parameter forces activity data reload

## Analysis of Current Code Structure

### Startup Flow (main.py â†’ src/projectcatalog.py)
- `main.py` imports and calls `run_webserver()` from `src.projectcatalog`
- `run_webserver()` immediately starts:
  - Analysis worker thread (`analyze_projects_worker`)
  - Directory watcher thread (`directory_watcher`)
  - Heartbeat monitor thread (monitors analysis thread health)
- Then starts the Bottle web server on port 5001

### Activity Data Flow
- Activity tracking is handled by `src/activity_tracker.py`
- Uses caching with 10-minute timeout in `.activity_cache.json`
- Manual refresh via `?refresh=true` parameter in URLs
- `get_recent_activity()` function loads data for directories

## Planned Solution

### 1. Deferred Background Thread Startup
- Make UI available immediately
- Start background threads after initial web server is responsive
- Add loading states for features that depend on background processing

### 2. Automatic Activity Data Loading
- Load activity data automatically on page load using AJAX
- Add loading indicators while data is being fetched
- Remove need for manual "Refresh Activity Data" button click

### 3. Progressive Loading Strategy
- Show basic UI shell immediately
- Load project data progressively as background threads complete analysis
- Use WebSocket or SSE for real-time updates

## Next Steps
1. Modify startup sequence to prioritize UI responsiveness
2. Add AJAX endpoints for activity data loading
3. Update frontend templates with loading states
4. Test performance improvements
