# Progress Update - 2025-05-12

## Completed "Type" Field Removal from Prompt Manager

We have successfully removed the "type" field from the Prompt Manager codebase and fixed the related issues. Here's a summary of the changes and fixes:

1. Removed the Type column from the prompts list table
2. Fixed the prompt_editor.html file to use "is-composite-badge" instead of "prompt-type-badge"
3. Removed the type field from the front matter of prompt files, including restart.md
4. Updated the SMS Challenge restart.md file to include proper front matter with description
5. Fixed JavaScript code that was still trying to reference the type field

### Testing Performed

Testing confirms that all features are now working correctly:

1. The prompts list page no longer displays a Type column
2. The prompt editor successfully loads prompts from different directories
3. The composite/standard badge is correctly shown based on the prompt content
4. No JavaScript errors when loading or editing prompts

### Next Steps

- Continue monitoring for any remaining references to "type" in the codebase
- Consider cleaning up the "type" field from all prompt front matter across all directories
- Update any other templates that might still reference the type field

This completes the task of removing the unnecessary type field from the Prompt Manager. The application now uses the `is_composite` property method to dynamically determine if a prompt is composite based on its content, making the system more streamlined and easier to maintain.
