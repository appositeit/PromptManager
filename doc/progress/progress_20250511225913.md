# Progress Update - May 11, 2025 (Button Visibility Fix)

## Issue Identified

The Copy, Toggle View, and Search/Replace buttons on the prompt edit page were invisible until hovered over, making it difficult for users to find and use these important functions.

## Root Cause

The issue was found in the CSS styling for outline buttons. In `main.css`, the `.btn-outline-primary` class and other outline button classes did not have a background color specified for their default state. Without a defined background color, the buttons were rendering with a transparent background, making them invisible against the white page background.

```css
/* Before fix - missing background color */
.btn-outline-primary {
    border-color: var(--primary-color);
    color: var(--primary-color);
}
```

While the buttons had visible borders and text color defined, this was not sufficient to make them stand out on the white page background.

## Solution Implemented

Added explicit background color styling to all outline button classes in the `main.css` file:

```css
/* After fix - with background color */
.btn-outline-primary {
    border-color: var(--primary-color);
    color: var(--primary-color);
    background-color: white;
}

/* Fix for other outline buttons */
.btn-outline-secondary, 
.btn-outline-success, 
.btn-outline-danger, 
.btn-outline-warning, 
.btn-outline-info {
    background-color: white;
}
```

This ensures that all outline-style buttons have a visible white background in their default state, making them clearly visible against any page background.

## Impact and Benefits

1. **Improved Usability**: All buttons are now immediately visible without requiring hover actions
2. **Better Accessibility**: Important editing controls are now clearly visible to all users
3. **Consistent UI**: Buttons now have a consistent appearance across all states
4. **Reduced User Confusion**: No more "hidden" functionality that users might miss

The fix maintains the existing hover behavior where the background changes to the button's theme color, providing clear visual feedback when interacting with the buttons.

## Testing

The fix was tested by restarting the server and confirming that all buttons on the prompt edit page are now clearly visible in their default state, with the expected hover behavior still working as intended.
