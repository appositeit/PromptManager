## UI Improvements for Prompt Management

### Changes Made

1. **Relocated "Add Directory" button**:
   - Moved the "Add Directory" button from the top action bar to just above the Directories table
   - This creates a clearer association between the button and the table it affects
   - Enhances UI organization by grouping related elements together

2. **Removed "Create Default Prompts" button**:
   - Eliminated the "Create Default Prompts" button and modal as requested
   - Simplified the UI by removing unused functionality
   - Keeps the focus on core prompt management features

3. **Enhanced search functionality**:
   - Implemented direct filtering when user types without requiring a search button click
   - Added automatic focus on the search box when the user starts typing
   - Expanded search to match on directory path (in addition to ID and description)
   - Added keyboard navigation to allow using arrow keys to browse results while search is focused
   - Implemented visual highlighting of selected rows for better navigation feedback
   - This allows users to quickly filter prompts by typing, use up/down arrows to select, and hit enter to edit

### Implementation Details

1. **Directory button relocation**:
   - Moved the button into the Directories card header with flexbox styling for alignment
   - Used Bootstrap's utility classes for positioning and styling consistency
   - This gives the Directories section its own clear action button

2. **Enhanced search experience**:
   - Added event handler to capture keystrokes when no input field is focused
   - Modified the search filter logic to include directory paths in the matches
   - Maintained backward compatibility with the search button for users who prefer clicking
   - Enhanced keyboard navigation to work when search box is focused:
     - Up/down arrows to navigate the list
     - Enter to edit the selected prompt
     - Selection visually highlighted with subtle blue outline and background
   - Added automatic selection of first item when search results change

### Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**:
   - More intuitive UI organization with related controls grouped together
   - Faster workflow with immediate filtering as users type
   - More powerful search capability by including directory paths in matching

2. **Cleaner Interface**:
   - Removed unnecessary elements that were adding clutter
   - More focused interface that prioritizes the core functionality
   - Better alignment with user expectations about where to find controls

### Next Steps

1. Consider adding additional filter options if needed based on user feedback
2. Evaluate if any additional keyboard shortcuts would benefit the interface
3. Monitor user interaction with the new search functionality for any further improvements
