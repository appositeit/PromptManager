## Server Exit Endpoint and WebSocket Interface Verification

I've verified that both the server exit endpoint and WebSocket interface of the Prompt Manager are working correctly:

### Exit Endpoint Verification
- The `/api/stop` endpoint works as expected, immediately stopping the server
- The server process is properly terminated without any orphaned processes
- This ensures users can restart the server cleanly without port conflicts

### WebSocket Interface Verification
- The WebSocket interface successfully connects to prompts for real-time editing
- The WebSocket route at `/api/prompts/ws/project_maintenance_rules` functions correctly
- The system dynamically loads prompts from multiple directories
- The WebSocket interface successfully sends initial data and handles update requests

### System Health
- The system properly initializes prompts from configured directories
- The logging system works as expected, with properly formatted timestamp information
- Error handling for edge cases (like invalid YAML frontmatter) works as intended

## Startup Process Improvement
When starting the Prompt Manager, the following steps ensure a clean environment:
1. The system creates timestamp-based log files for better debugging
2. The system checks if a server is already running, preventing port conflicts
3. The environment is properly set up with the virtual environment

## Current Status
The Prompt Manager is fully functional and ready to use. The exit endpoint and WebSocket interface have been verified to work correctly, which were the main requested checkpoints.

The improved start script handles edge cases properly and ensures the server runs in a clean environment.
