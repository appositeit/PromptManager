## Bug Fixes for Prompt Editor and WebSocket Connection

### Issues Fixed

1. **Fixed Prompt Editor Form Fields**:
   - Added missing metadata form fields (description and tags) that were causing JavaScript errors
   - Added the "last-updated" span for displaying the timestamp
   - This fixes the error: "Cannot set properties of null (setting 'value')"

2. **Added WebSocket Route Implementation**:
   - Created a new WebSocket routes module in `src/api/websocket_routes.py`
   - Implemented proper WebSocket connection management for real-time prompt editing
   - Fixed the 403 Forbidden error when connecting to the WebSocket
   - Added proper expansion functionality for composite prompts

3. **Improved JavaScript Imports**:
   - Updated the prompt_editor.html to properly import utils.js
   - Removed duplicated showToast implementation in favor of the unified utility function

### Implementation Details

1. **WebSocket Implementation**:
   - Created a ConnectionManager class to handle client connections
   - Implemented proper WebSocket message handling for prompt updates
   - Added support for content expansion and dependency tracking
   - Fixed the WebSocket endpoint path to match the client-side expectations

2. **UI Improvements**:
   - Added proper form layout for metadata fields
   - Ensured consistent visual styling
   - Fixed the connection between UI form fields and WebSocket updates

### Benefits

1. **Enhanced Reliability**:
   - Fixed critical bugs that prevented proper usage of the prompt editor
   - Eliminated JavaScript errors that could confuse users
   - Restored the core functionality of the application

2. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Real-time updates when editing composite prompts
   - Proper metadata editing with instant feedback
   - Smoother overall workflow without errors

### Next Steps

1. **Further Testing**:
   - Test WebSocket connections with larger prompts
   - Verify behavior with multiple concurrent clients
   
2. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Consider optimizing expansion of very large prompts
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed dependencies
