# WebSocket API Testing - Progress Update (2025-05-13)

## Overview

This update focuses on implementing comprehensive testing for the WebSocket API functionality in the Prompt Manager. The WebSocket implementation enables real-time fragment editing, and we've now added a robust test suite to ensure its reliability for future projects.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Analyzed existing WebSocket implementation**:
   - Examined the `websocket_routes.py` code to understand the implementation
   - Identified key components: ConnectionManager, fragment_websocket_endpoint
   - Reviewed the existing manual test script (`test_websocket.py`)

2. **Created unit test suite**:
   - Implemented tests for the ConnectionManager class
   - Created tests for the WebSocket route handlers
   - Added error handling tests for various failure scenarios
   - Mocked dependencies to ensure isolated testing

3. **Implemented integration tests**:
   - Created tests that run against a live server instance
   - Tests WebSocket connections, updates, and broadcasts
   - Verifies real-time updates between multiple clients
   - Automatically sets up and tears down test environment

4. **Added end-to-end test script**:
   - Created a comprehensive test script in `bin/test_websocket_api.py`
   - Tests all aspects of the WebSocket API
   - Can be run against a running server instance
   - Provides detailed reporting of test results

5. **Updated test runner**:
   - Modified `run_tests.py` to use pytest for the WebSocket tests
   - Added automatic dependency installation
   - Ensures all tests are run with appropriate test runners

6. **Added documentation**:
   - Created README_WEBSOCKET_TESTS.md with detailed testing instructions
   - Documented test structure and coverage
   - Provided instructions for running different types of tests

## Test Coverage

The test suite now covers:

- **Connection management**: Connecting, disconnecting, and broadcasting
- **Fragment operations**: Content updates, metadata updates, expansion
- **Concurrency**: Multiple clients and real-time updates
- **Error handling**: Invalid fragments, connection errors, and server errors

## Next Steps

1. Run the complete test suite to verify all tests pass
2. Monitor WebSocket performance in production
3. Consider adding load testing for WebSocket connections

## Conclusions

The WebSocket API now has comprehensive test coverage, making it a reliable foundation for future projects. The tests provide confidence in the stability of the real-time editing functionality and will help catch regressions during future development.
