# WebSocket API Improvements - Progress Update (2025-05-13 01:59)

## Overview

This update provides the results of addressing issues with the WebSocket API in the Prompt Manager. The WebSocket API enables real-time editing of prompts and fragments, but there were several issues with error handling and API compatibility that needed to be fixed.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Error Handling in WebSocket Updates**
   - Updated the WebSocket implementation to not broadcast updates when saves fail
   - This prevents data inconsistency issues where other clients would receive updates that didn't actually get saved
   - Fixed a failing unit test case in test_websocket_errors.py

2. **Refactored Fragment WebSocket Implementation**
   - Updated the WebSocket fragment_websocket_endpoint to use the Prompt Service instead of the Fragment Service
   - This aligns with the recent architectural changes where the Fragment API has been redirected to the Prompt API
   - Ensures compatibility with the current codebase structure

3. **Fixed WebSocket Route Declarations**
   - Corrected route declarations to use full paths instead of relative paths with prefix
   - Ensures proper routing and avoids conflicts with other routes
   - This fixed issues with multiple prefixes being added to routes

4. **Added Testing Support**
   - Added a create_app() function to server.py to support testing
   - This allows integration tests to create an app instance for testing

## Test Results

1. **Unit Tests**: ✅ ALL PASSING (18/18)
   - Connection Manager tests pass
   - WebSocket Routes tests pass
   - Error Handling tests pass

2. **End-to-End Tests**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY PASSING
   - Debug WebSocket endpoint works correctly
   - Prompt/Fragment specific endpoints still have issues with 403 errors
   - Likely related to CORS or authentication settings

## Remaining Issues

1. **403 Errors with WebSocket connections**
   - When connecting to the prompt/fragment WebSocket endpoints from a script, connections are rejected with 403 Forbidden errors
   - However, these same endpoints work correctly when connected from a browser
   - This suggests there might be CORS or security settings that are blocking programmatic access

2. **Integration Tests Not Running**
   - Integration tests have import issues due to the structure of the server.py file
   - Although we added the create_app() function, additional modifications to the tests would be needed

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate and Fix 403 Errors**
   - Check CORS settings to ensure they allow WebSocket connections from all sources
   - Verify if there are any authentication mechanisms blocking programmatic access
   - Update the test scripts to match the expected authentication pattern if needed

2. **Update Integration Tests**
   - Modify the integration tests to work with the current server implementation
   - Fix import issues and ensure they correctly set up and tear down the test environment

3. **Create Additional End-to-End Tests**
   - Develop more comprehensive tests for all WebSocket API functionality
   - Ensure tests can be run automatically as part of CI/CD pipelines

## Conclusion

The WebSocket API implementation has been improved with better error handling and compatibility with the current architecture. Unit tests are now all passing, which indicates that the core functionality is working correctly. However, there are still issues with end-to-end testing from external scripts, likely due to security settings. Further investigation is needed to resolve these remaining issues before the WebSocket API can be fully utilized in other projects.
