# Progress Update - May 11, 2025 - Directory Refresh Fix

## Fixed Directory Refresh Functionality

### Issue Description
When clicking the refresh button for a directory in the fragments management page, users encountered the following error:
```
Error refreshing directory: Failed to refresh directory: 405 Method Not Allowed
```

This occurred because the fragments directory refresh endpoint was missing in the API implementation.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. The fragments API routes were not properly separated from the prompts API routes
2. The directory refresh endpoint for fragments was not implemented
3. The frontend was trying to use the prompts endpoint for fragments, causing the 405 Method Not Allowed error

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Created Dedicated Fragments API Router
- Created a new `fragments_router.py` file to handle all fragment-related API endpoints
- Implemented the fragments directory refresh endpoint `/api/prompts/fragments/directories/{directory_path:path}/reload`
- Separated fragment-specific logic from the general prompts router

#### 2. Updated the Unified Router
- Modified the unified_router.py file to include the new fragments router
- Ensured API endpoint separation while maintaining backwards compatibility

#### 3. Fixed Frontend Refresh Functionality
- Updated the directory refresh function in the manage_fragments.html file to use the correct endpoint path
- Enhanced the showToast function to support different toast types (success, danger, info)
- Improved error handling to provide more informative messages

### Benefits
1. **Improved Reliability**: Directory refresh functionality now works correctly
2. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Fragment and prompt APIs are now properly separated
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Error messages are more informative and visually distinctive
4. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error feedback helps users understand and resolve issues

### Technical Implementation
- Used the FastAPI path parameter format to correctly handle directory paths with special characters
- Implemented proper error handling in both the backend API and frontend code
- Used encodeURIComponent to ensure directory paths are correctly encoded in API requests

### Next Steps
1. Potentially implement a similar API structure for templates management
2. Add better validation on the backend for directory paths
3. Consider implementing a background task system for large directory refreshes
