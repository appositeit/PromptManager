# Progress Update: Fixed Expanded Content View Overflow Issues

## Issue
The expanded content view had a UI issue where the white background "box" behind the text only extended to the size of the edit box. When content overflowed beyond that box, it appeared messy as the background color didn't extend with the content.

## Fix
Applied CSS fixes to ensure the white background extends to cover all content in the expanded view:

1. Added specific styles for the expanded pane, container, and content elements
2. Set the background color to white for all relevant elements
3. Modified the height to be auto with a min-height set to maintain consistent appearance
4. Added width: 100% to ensure the background properly covers all content horizontally

## Files Modified
- `/home/jem/development/prompt_manager/src/static/css/main.css` - Added styles for expanded content view
- `/home/jem/development/prompt_manager/src/templates/fragment_editor.html` - Added specific CSS fixes for the expanded view tab

These changes ensure that the expanded content view maintains a clean, consistent appearance even when the content overflows the initial container size.
