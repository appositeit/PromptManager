# Progress Update - 2025-05-12

## Removed "Type" Field from Prompt Manager

As requested, we have removed the "type" field from the Prompt Manager codebase. The changes include:

1. Modified `unified_prompt.py` model to rely on `is_composite` property method instead of explicit type enumeration
2. Updated the prompt service to no longer handle type-related operations
3. Updated the API routes to remove type-related code
4. Updated the web UI to remove the Type column from the prompts table
5. Simplified UI filtering to only filter by tags and search terms, not by type

These changes make the codebase more streamlined and remove the unnecessary typing system that was being used. Now, prompts are simply classified as "composite" if they contain inclusions, which is determined dynamically by the `is_composite` property in the model.

### Files Modified

- `/src/models/unified_prompt.py` (kept the enum but code now uses the `is_composite` property)
- `/src/services/prompt_service.py` (removed type-related code)
- `/src/api/router.py` (removed type validation and related code)
- `/src/templates/manage_prompts.html` (removed Type column and related UI elements)

### UI Improvements

- Removed Type column from the prompts table
- Removed Type filter from the dropdown menu
- Fixed colspans in the table to reflect the removed column

### Testing

The changes were tested and verified by:
1. Checking the codebase for any references to the type field
2. Starting the server after changes
3. Using Puppeteer to visually confirm that the Type column is no longer present

The Prompt Manager is now functioning correctly without the type field, and the UI is cleaner without the extra column.

## Next Steps

- Continue to use the is_composite property for determining if a prompt is a composite
- Monitor for any issues related to the removal of the type field
- Consider if any further UI improvements are needed
