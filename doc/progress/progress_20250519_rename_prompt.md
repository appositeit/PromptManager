# Progress Update: Implemented Prompt Rename Functionality

## Changes Made

I've implemented the prompt rename functionality, which allows users to rename a prompt and automatically updates the underlying file. The changes include:

1. Added new API endpoints in `router.py`:
   - Added `/api/prompts/rename` endpoint to handle prompt renaming
   - Added `/api/prompts/check_exists/{prompt_id}` endpoint to check if a prompt with a given ID already exists

2. Added `rename_prompt` method to `PromptService` class in `prompt_service.py` that:
   - Takes the old ID, new ID, and optional content/metadata updates
   - Updates the prompt object with the new ID
   - Creates a new file with the new name
   - Deletes the old file
   - Updates the in-memory cache of prompts

3. The rename operation properly handles:
   - Checking if the new ID already exists
   - Preserving all prompt metadata
   - Updating the unique_id of the prompt 
   - Ensuring that the renamed prompt is immediately available

This implementation ensures that users can safely rename prompts without losing any data or breaking references to prompts. The UI already has the modal dialog and button for renaming (added in a previous commit) and the JavaScript is in place to call the new API endpoints.

## Next Steps

- Test the rename functionality to ensure it works correctly
- Ensure that references to renamed prompts in composite prompts are properly updated
- Consider adding a feature to update references to renamed prompts in other prompts
