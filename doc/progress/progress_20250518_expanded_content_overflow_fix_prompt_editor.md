# Progress Update: Fixed Expanded Content View Background in Prompt Editor

## Issue
In the prompt editor, the expanded content view had a background white "box" that only extended to the size of the edit box. When content overflowed beyond that box, it appeared outside the white background, creating a visual inconsistency.

## Fix
Applied CSS and JavaScript fixes to ensure the white background extends to cover all content in the expanded view:

1. Added specific styles for the expanded content pane and preview elements:
   - Set the background color to white for all relevant elements
   - Modified the height to be auto with a min-height set to maintain consistent appearance
   - Added width: 100% to ensure proper coverage horizontally

2. Added dynamic height adjustment in JavaScript:
   - When content is loaded into the expanded view, the container's height is now adjusted to fit the content
   - Added code to measure the actual content height and adjust the container accordingly
   - Implemented the fix in all code paths that update the expanded content

3. Added background color enforcement when switching tabs to ensure consistent display

## Files Modified

These changes ensure that the expanded content view in the prompt editor maintains a clean, consistent appearance even when the content overflows the initial container size.
