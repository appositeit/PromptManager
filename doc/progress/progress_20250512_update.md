# Progress Update - May 12, 2025 (Update)

## Improved Prompt Loading Functionality

Building on the previous bug fixes, we've made the following improvements to ensure prompts are properly loaded on page initialization:

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Loading Process

- Modified the loading functions to return Promises for better error handling and sequencing
- Implemented automatic retry logic for prompt loading (3 retries with a 1-second delay)
- Added proper error display in the UI when loading fails

### 2. Concurrent Loading with Error Handling

- Updated the page initialization to use Promise.all for concurrent loading of prompts and directories
- Added proper error handling and display of error messages if loading fails
- Implemented logging to aid in debugging loading issues

### 3. Automatic Prompt Reload When Needed

- Added logic to detect when directories are loaded but prompts aren't
- Implemented automatic prompts reload when this situation is detected
- Made sure the loading status is properly displayed to the user

### 4. Improved Refresh All Functionality

- Enhanced the refreshAllDirectories function with better error handling
- Added fallback mechanisms for when the primary refresh operation fails
- Improved messaging to inform the user about the status of refresh operations

### Result

The prompt management interface now reliably loads prompts on page initialization. This ensures that users can immediately see their prompts without having to manually refresh the page. 

The loading process is also more robust with proper error handling and automatic retries, making the system more resilient against temporary network or server issues that could prevent prompts from loading.
