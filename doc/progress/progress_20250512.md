## Recursion Handling Improvements

We've fixed the recursion handling in template inclusion processing to use a more efficient approach that doesn't rely on recursion depth tracking. The key improvements are:

### Changes to `expand_inclusions` in `prompt_service.py`

The function now uses a set-based approach to track included prompts:

1. Instead of limiting recursion depth to 10 levels, we now properly track each prompt that has been included in the expansion chain
2. Circular dependencies are detected by checking if a prompt is already in the inclusion set
3. This approach is more memory-efficient and doesn't impose arbitrary depth limits
4. The implementation properly detects circular references and continues processing the rest of the file

### Benefits

- No arbitrary recursion depth limits - all templates can be processed regardless of nesting depth
- More efficient detection of circular dependencies
- Improper prompt inclusions are handled gracefully with appropriate warnings
- Tests have been updated to verify deep nesting works correctly

All tests are now passing, confirming the recursion handling is working as expected.

## Next Steps

1. Continue running tests to verify all functionality works properly
2. Consider implementing additional improvements to error messaging for circular dependencies
3. Update documentation to reflect the new approach to handling template inclusions
