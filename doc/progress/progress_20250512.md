## Prompt Manager Bug Fixes

### 1. Fixed "type" field removal issues

Following up on the removal of the "type" field from the Prompt model, we encountered JavaScript errors related to `prompt_type` references in the frontend code. The specific error was:

```
Error displaying prompts: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'charAt')
```

This occurred when trying to render the prompt type in the UI, but the `prompt_type` field was no longer present in the API response.

### Changes Made

1. **Updated Type Cell Rendering in Prompt Table**:
   - Modified the code to determine if a prompt is composite based on inclusion markers rather than using the type field
   - Implemented logic to render "Composite" or "Standard" badges based on content inspection

2. **Fixed Filtering Functionality**:
   - Updated filter logic to filter based on content inclusion markers rather than the type field
   - Simplified the type filters to just "All", "Standard" and "Composite" options

3. **Updated Sorting Functionality**:
   - Modified the sort logic for the "Type" column to sort based on composite detection rather than type field

4. **Removed Type Selection from New Prompt Form**:
   - Removed the now-unnecessary type selection dropdown from the create prompt form
   - Updated prompt creation logic to no longer include the type field

5. **Updated Default Prompts Template**:
   - Removed prompt_type field from the default prompt templates used for preset content

### Result

The prompt management interface now works correctly with the revised data model that no longer includes the "type" field. Prompt lists load correctly and the "Refresh All" button works without errors.

The implementation now classifies prompts as either "Standard" or "Composite" based on their content rather than a specified type field, providing a simpler and more intuitive classification system while maintaining backward compatibility with existing prompts.
