# Prompt Management UI Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Blacklist Button from Directory Deletion Dialog

- Removed the "Blacklist" button from the directory deletion confirmation dialog
- Deleted all associated JavaScript code related to blacklisting functionality
- Simplified the dialog to only include "Cancel" and "Remove" options
- This aligns with the decision to remove all blacklist functionality from the application

### 2. Added Alt+N Keyboard Shortcut for New Prompt

- Implemented an Alt+N keyboard shortcut to open the "New Prompt" dialog from anywhere on the prompt management page
- Added title attribute to the New Prompt button to indicate the keyboard shortcut
- When triggered, the shortcut not only opens the dialog but also automatically focuses the Prompt ID field for immediate typing

### 2. Removed Content Textarea from New Prompt Dialog

- Removed the large Content textarea from the New Prompt dialog
- This improves the user experience by:
  - Making the dialog more compact
  - Ensuring the "Create" button is always visible without scrolling
  - Focusing the user on the essential metadata (ID, directory, tags) for prompt creation
- Content is now created in the prompt editor page instead
- Updated all associated JavaScript to function correctly without the content field
- Role selection still works properly, setting tags but not content

## Benefits

- More efficient workflow: The keyboard shortcut allows quick access to prompt creation
- Better user experience: The more compact dialog focuses on core information needed for creation
- Proper separation of concerns: Metadata is set in the dialog, content is created in the editor
- The "Create" button is now always visible, preventing user frustration
- Simplified directory management: Removed unnecessary blacklist functionality, making directory removal more straightforward
- Cleaner UI: Deletion dialog is now more focused with just two clear options

## Implementation Details

- Added event listener for Alt+N keypress to open the New Prompt modal
- Modified the createPrompt function to handle empty content appropriately
- Updated the role selection handler to only set tags, not content
- Ensured all form clearing and reset functionality works correctly

These changes enhance the usability of the prompt management interface while maintaining all existing functionality.
