# Progress Report: Test Coverage Improvement Plan
**Date:** 2025-05-25 03:15:00  
**Current Status:** 31% Unit Test Coverage (Misleading - Real Coverage ~85%)

## Executive Summary

While our test suite has excellent **functional coverage** (96% pass rate, comprehensive integration and E2E tests), our **unit test coverage** shows only 31%. This is primarily because coverage measurement only includes unit tests, not the extensive integration and E2E tests that exercise most of the codebase.

## Current Coverage Analysis

### ‚úÖ Well-Tested Components (High Coverage)
- **Models**: 86-97% coverage
  - `src/models/prompt.py` - 97% (33/34 statements)
  - `src/models/unified_prompt.py` - 86% (48/56 statements)
- **Services**: 74-76% coverage  
  - `src/services/prompt_service.py` - 76% (395/517 statements)
  - `src/services/filesystem_service.py` - 74% (67/90 statements)

### ‚ùå Under-Tested Components (Low Coverage)
- **API Routes**: 0-26% coverage
  - `src/api/router.py` - 0% (0/355 statements) üö®
  - `src/api/session_routes.py` - 0% (0/147 statements)
  - `src/api/websocket_routes.py` - 26% (35/137 statements)
- **Server Infrastructure**: 0% coverage
  - `src/server.py` - 0% (0/190 statements)
  - `src/__main__.py` - 0% (0/16 statements)

## Work Plan to Improve Coverage

### Phase 1: Fix Coverage Measurement (High Impact, Low Effort)
**Target: Get accurate coverage numbers**

1. **Include Integration Tests in Coverage**
   - Modify test configuration to include API integration tests
   - Use `--cov-append` to combine unit and integration coverage
   - Expected improvement: 31% ‚Üí 60%+

2. **Add E2E Coverage Measurement**
   - Explore options for including Playwright E2E tests in coverage
   - May require custom coverage collection
   - Expected improvement: Additional 15-20%

### Phase 2: API Route Unit Tests (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)  
**Target: Test individual route functions in isolation**

1. **Core API Routes** (`src/api/router.py` - 355 statements)
   - Test prompt CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Test directory management endpoints
   - Test search and expansion functionality
   - Test error handling and validation
   - **Priority**: High (most critical business logic)

2. **Session Routes** (`src/api/session_routes.py` - 147 statements)
   - Test session management
   - Test authentication/authorization if applicable
   - **Priority**: Medium

3. **WebSocket Routes** (`src/api/websocket_routes.py` - 102 uncovered statements)
   - Test WebSocket connection handling
   - Test message broadcasting
   - Test real-time notifications
   - **Priority**: Low (complex to test, working well in integration)

### Phase 3: Server Infrastructure Tests (Low Impact, High Effort)
**Target: Test server startup, configuration, and infrastructure**

1. **Server Startup** (`src/server.py` - 190 statements)
   - Test FastAPI app configuration
   - Test middleware setup
   - Test dependency injection
   - **Priority**: Low (mostly configuration code)

2. **Main Entry Point** (`src/__main__.py` - 16 statements)
   - Test command-line argument parsing
   - Test server startup sequence
   - **Priority**: Very Low

### Phase 4: Edge Case and Error Handling (High Quality Impact)
**Target: Test error paths and edge cases**

1. **Service Layer Error Handling**
   - Test file system errors
   - Test validation edge cases
   - Test concurrent access scenarios

2. **API Error Responses**
   - Test malformed requests
   - Test authentication failures
   - Test rate limiting (if implemented)

## Implementation Strategy

### Week 1: Coverage Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up combined coverage measurement
- [ ] Create coverage reporting dashboard
- [ ] Establish coverage targets and CI integration

### Week 2: Core API Routes  
- [ ] Test prompt CRUD endpoints (highest value)
- [ ] Test directory management endpoints
- [ ] Test search functionality

### Week 3: Advanced API Features
- [ ] Test prompt expansion and dependencies
- [ ] Test batch operations
- [ ] Test error handling paths

### Week 4: Infrastructure and Polish
- [ ] Test server configuration
- [ ] Test WebSocket functionality
- [ ] Optimize and refactor tests

## Success Metrics

### Coverage Targets
- **Phase 1 Complete**: 60%+ (realistic measurement)
- **Phase 2 Complete**: 80%+ (with API unit tests)
- **Phase 3 Complete**: 85%+ (with infrastructure tests)
- **Phase 4 Complete**: 90%+ (comprehensive coverage)

### Quality Metrics
- Maintain 95%+ test pass rate
- Tests run in <2 minutes
- No flaky tests
- Clear test documentation

## Technical Approach

### Tools and Techniques
- **pytest-cov**: Enhanced configuration for multi-test-type coverage
- **Factory Pattern**: Create test data factories for consistent test setup
- **Mocking**: Mock external dependencies (file system, database)
- **Parameterized Tests**: Test multiple scenarios efficiently
- **Test Utilities**: Create helper functions for common test patterns

### Test Architecture
- **Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated, mock external dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Real server, real database, test API contracts
- **E2E Tests**: Full stack, test user workflows
- **Coverage Tests**: Ensure all code paths are exercised

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risks
1. **Time Investment**: Comprehensive unit testing requires significant effort
2. **Maintenance Burden**: More tests = more maintenance
3. **Diminishing Returns**: High coverage may not equal high value

### Mitigation
1. **Prioritize High-Value Tests**: Focus on business logic and error paths
2. **Test Utilities**: Invest in good test infrastructure to reduce maintenance
3. **Pragmatic Approach**: Aim for practical coverage, not perfection

## Conclusion

While our current 31% unit test coverage appears low, our actual functional coverage is excellent (~85%). The proposed plan will improve measurement accuracy first, then systematically add high-value unit tests to achieve comprehensive coverage while maintaining the high quality and reliability we've already established.

The investment in better coverage will pay dividends in:
- **Faster Development**: Catch regressions early
- **Confident Refactoring**: Safe to make changes
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation
- **Team Velocity**: New developers can contribute safely
