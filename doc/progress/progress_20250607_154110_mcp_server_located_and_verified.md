# Progress Update: MCP Server Located and Verified

**Date**: 2025-06-07 15:41:10  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - MCP Server Found and Working  
**Serena**: ✅ Activated for project directory

## Summary

The MCP server code was **not missing** - it's alive and well in the current codebase. The confusion arose from organizational changes, but all functionality is intact and working.

## Current MCP Server Status

### ✅ Located MCP Server Components

**Primary Server**: `/home/jem/development/prompt_manager/src/mcp_server/`
- `server.py` - Main MCP server implementation (18,871 bytes)
- `__init__.py` - Package initialization

**Management Scripts**: All present in `bin/`
- `start_mcp_server.sh` 
- `stop_mcp_server.sh`
- `restart_mcp_server.sh`
- `isalive_mcp_server.sh`
- `test_mcp_client.py`

**Integration Components**: Distributed across codebase
- `src/api/mcp_router.py` - API routing
- `src/services/mcp.py` - Service layer
- `src/models/mcp.py` - Data models
- `src/templates/mcp_servers.html` - UI template

### ✅ Server Verification

**Running Status**: ✅ Active (PID: 113677)
```bash
$ ./bin/isalive_mcp_server.sh
✓ MCP server is running (PID: 113677)
```

**Functionality Test**: ✅ All tests passing
```bash
$ ./bin/test_mcp_client.py
✓ Connected to MCP server
✓ Initialize response received
✓ Tools list: 7 tools found
✓ List prompts working
✓ Ping response received
✓ All tests completed successfully!
```

### ✅ Available MCP Tools

The server provides 7 tools for prompt management:
1. `list_prompts` - List all available prompts
2. `get_prompt` - Get specific prompt by ID  
3. `search_prompts` - Search prompts by text content
4. `expand_prompt` - Expand prompt with all inclusions resolved
5. `create_prompt` - Create new prompt
6. `update_prompt` - Update existing prompt  
7. `delete_prompt` - Delete prompt

## Architecture Notes

**Design Change**: The MCP functionality was refactored from a single `mcp_server/` directory in the project root into a modular structure:
- Core server: `src/mcp_server/`
- API integration: `src/api/mcp_router.py`
- Business logic: `src/services/mcp.py`
- Data models: `src/models/mcp.py`

This follows better separation of concerns and aligns with the project's modular architecture.

## Serena Activation

✅ **Serena MCP is active** for this project directory:
- Configuration: `.serena/project.yml`
- Memory cache: `.serena/memories/`
- Project cache: `.serena/cache/`

## Fixed: MCP Management Scripts

✅ **Scripts now properly support MCP STDIO communication**:

**Key Fixes Applied**:
- ❌ Removed `nohup` and output redirection (breaks MCP protocol)
- ✅ Run server in foreground with clean STDIO
- ✅ All user messages redirected to stderr (preserves MCP stdout)
- ✅ Proper virtual environment activation
- ✅ **Multiple instances supported** - no conflict checking (each OCD can have its own MCP server)
- ✅ Fixed process detection using command pattern matching

**Verified Working**:
- `./bin/start_mcp_server.sh` - Starts server with proper STDIO
- `./bin/stop_mcp_server.sh` - Finds and stops server processes  
- `./bin/isalive_mcp_server.sh` - Detects running server
- `./bin/restart_mcp_server.sh` - Clean restart cycle

**Test Results**: ✅ Started successfully, loaded 78 prompts, proper MCP communication

## Recommendations

1. ✅ **MCP server fully functional** with fixed management scripts
2. Use `./bin/start_mcp_server.sh` for proper MCP STDIO communication
3. Documentation added: `bin/README_MCP.md` explains MCP-specific requirements

## Context

This investigation was triggered by confusion about missing MCP code after a tidy-up. The code was never deleted - it was reorganized into a cleaner, more maintainable structure. All functionality remains intact and the server is actively serving MCP requests.
